{"prompt":"To facilitate sharing and remove choke points, infrastructure sharing companies have emerged. An infrastructure sharing company typically buys and leases back a piece of infrastructure like a cell tower to enable sharing. Three mobile network operators sharing one cell tower results in lower operating and maintenance costs for all compared to a situation when one mobile network company uses one tower all by itself. Lowering of operating costs makes it more feasible to serve customers who want to get online but cannot afford to do so.\nAt present 62% of total cell phone towers around the world are owned by infrastructure sharing companies, and while that number looks encouraging do bear in mind that cell towers are just one piece of internet infrastructure.

{"prompt":"Do Your Commitments Match Your Convictions?\nThis paper needs to be read at a leisurely pace, it had one very potent exercise though:\n\u201cThe first step in managing your commitments is to take a quick inventory of what matters to you. (For a helpful work sheet, see the exhibit \u201cTaking Stock.\u201d) You probably have at least a vague sense of what you value most, but it\u2019s important to clarify those themes from time to time. This exercise lets you check whether you are putting your money (and your time and energy) where your mouth is. A systematic inventory of where your money, time, and energy are going often reveals surprising gaps.\u201d\nIn addition to Desktime, I think your credit card statement or a tool like Expenify can help fill the money column most accurately. Energy is subjective, but a good rule of thumb: energy is maximum 90 minutes after waking up and then declines through out the day. So give more weightage to activities done 90 minutes after waking up. Clearly answering e mails shouldn\u2019t be the first order of business!\nSome gems from this paper:\n\u201cOur most binding commitments are frequently the result of day-to-day decisions too small to attract our attention.\u201d\n\u201cThe ruts that lock people into active inertia are the very commitments that led to their past successes but that have now hardened: Strategic frames become blinders, selected processes lapse into routines, relationships turn into shackles, resources become millstones, and once vibrant values ossify into dogmas.\u201d\n\u201cSome of us experience \u201ccommitment creep.\u201d We often commit ourselves without really thinking about what we are taking on. It is very easy to say yes to new commitments without reflecting on the long-term costs of honoring the implied promises or the potential conflicts that may develop with existing commitments.\u201d\nImportance of crises:\nCrises force people to figure out what really matters.\nCrises force people to make choices.\nCrises can nullify outdated commitments.\nCrises prompt people to clear their diaries.\nCrises help to break the cycle of success.\n\u201cThe Clutter Trap.\nWe fall into this trap when we are not systematically undoing old commitments as we take on new ones. As a result, so many promises \u2014 new and old \u2014 call out for our time and other resources that we may meet none of them or simply fall back on what we were doing before. Many of us have experienced this in our professional lives when we attend management meetings that add new items to our to-do list without removing existing ones.

{"prompt":"Do Your Commitments Match Your Convictions?\nThis paper needs to be read at a leisurely pace, it had one very potent exercise though:\n\u201cThe first step in managing your commitments is to take a quick inventory of what matters to you. (For a helpful work sheet, see the exhibit \u201cTaking Stock.\u201d) You probably have at least a vague sense of what you value most, but it\u2019s important to clarify those themes from time to time. This exercise lets you check whether you are putting your money (and your time and energy) where your mouth is. A systematic inventory of where your money, time, and energy are going often reveals surprising gaps.\u201d\nIn addition to Desktime, I think your credit card statement or a tool like Expenify can help fill the money column most accurately. Energy is subjective, but a good rule of thumb: energy is maximum 90 minutes after waking up and then declines through out the day. So give more weightage to activities done 90 minutes after waking up. Clearly answering e mails shouldn\u2019t be the first order of business!\nSome gems from this paper:\n\u201cOur most binding commitments are frequently the result of day-to-day decisions too small to attract our attention.\u201d\n\u201cThe ruts that lock people into active inertia are the very commitments that led to their past successes but that have now hardened: Strategic frames become blinders, selected processes lapse into routines, relationships turn into shackles, resources become millstones, and once vibrant values ossify into dogmas.\u201d\n\u201cSome of us experience \u201ccommitment creep.\u201d We often commit ourselves without really thinking about what we are taking on. It is very easy to say yes to new commitments without reflecting on the long-term costs of honoring the implied promises or the potential conflicts that may develop with existing commitments.\u201d\nImportance of crises:\nCrises force people to figure out what really matters.\nCrises force people to make choices.\nCrises can nullify outdated commitments.\nCrises prompt people to clear their diaries.\nCrises help to break the cycle of success.\n\u201cThe Clutter Trap.\nWe fall into this trap when we are not systematically undoing old commitments as we take on new ones. As a result, so many promises \u2014 new and old \u2014 call out for our time and other resources that we may meet none of them or simply fall back on what we were doing before. Many of us have experienced this in our professional lives when we attend management meetings that add new items to our to-do list without removing existing ones. Taken as a whole, the agenda that emerges can be impossible. \u201c\nGroup Exercise: Write-down 25 goals, circle the 5 most important, and no matter what, don\u2019t do the rest!\nList of additional pathways explored:\nFinding your element, by Ken Robinson\nOne very cool exercise is auto-writing: write for 2\u20133 minutes anything that comes to your mind 5 minutes after waking up!\nLearned Optimism, by Martin Seligman\nConsider taking the Learned Optimism test\nHacking flow states, through the Flow Genome Project\nThe general view being that being in a state of flow allows for much better quality introspection. Mindfulness exercises through apps like Calm and Headpsace are highly recommended.\nQuestion: What does Angela Duckworth's book, Grit, teach about self-discovery?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

{"prompt":"To facilitate sharing and remove choke points, infrastructure sharing companies have emerged. An infrastructure sharing company typically buys and leases back a piece of infrastructure like a cell tower to enable sharing. Three mobile network operators sharing one cell tower results in lower operating and maintenance costs for all compared to a situation when one mobile network company uses one tower all by itself. Lowering of operating costs makes it more feasible to serve customers who want to get online but cannot afford to do so.\nAt present 62% of total cell phone towers around the world are owned by infrastructure sharing companies, and while that number looks encouraging do bear in mind that cell towers are just one piece of internet infrastructure. To highlight this point further, even today most mobile network operators are not sharing the electronic equipment which gets installed on cell towers.\nQuestion: What are some of the commitments you have made that you no longer want to keep?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}
