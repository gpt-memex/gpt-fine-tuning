{"prompt":"To some extent yes, but a global FabFi type wireless network will require access to something called spectrum. Spectrum is basically airwaves which are used by mobile network operators, TV stations and radio stations to transmit signals. Some spectrum like the one used by Wi-Fi routers or Bluetooth devices is free to use, most of it though, is allocated through auctions by governments. Governments have been known to charge as much as possible for licensing spectrum, and this desire to maximize spectrum price is a major factor other than the overlapping infrastructure capacity which keeps cost of connectivity high. The silver lining here is that similar to all other pieces of internet infrastructure, spectrum can also be shared.\nA great example of a product using amateur spectrum on a shared basis is FireChat, this product is a messenger that works without an internet connection because FireChat creates a network of smart phones.

Your duty is towards all stakeholders and not just shareholders\nDirectors are appointed by shareholders and shareholders can fire directors. This often leads to a view, as it did with me, that allegiance is solely with shareholders.

{"prompt":"So clearly we have a situation where the technology and infrastructure capacity both exist to reduce the cost of internet access, but such technologies are not well distributed. Why?\n\nPrimarily because mobile network operators have created an inflated cost base which makes it impossible to provide internet services to less affluent communities, but also because FabFi like solutions appear quite technical in nature. Good thing is that already there are many companies consciously innovating to make wireless communication equipment a lot more modular and user friendly.

{"prompt":"This intersection of internet infrastructure privatization and launch of wireless services worldwide created a gold rush of sorts because selling connectivity services without laying down cables or wires seemed like an attractive idea to investors in telecom companies. This also meant that many telecom companies offering virtually identical services would end up building excess and overlapping infrastructure to win over customers.\nFor example, when mobile network operators started building out their respective wireless networks around the world, they made a conscious decision not to share cell towers because in the early days of network roll outs, coverage was viewed as a competitive advantage. A mobile network operator with presence in 60 cities was a more promising story than one with presence in 50 cities. Thus, mobile network operators often constructed cell towers right next to each other and this choice led to a scenario which was equivalent to a country building 4 to 5 overlapping highways that could not connect with one another.\nQuestion: 1.

As a result, every user has the ability to receive and\/or deliver services across the infrastructure by utilizing a self provisioned network or by joining a network provided by any other user by joint agreement. Here is how the financial model works:\nWithin the municipal framework, utility infrastructure build costs are paid by the property owners desiring the utility service. This could be done via a standard municipal bond process which requires the support of the property owners who will receive the utility service.\nThe utility infrastructure maintenance and operational costs are paid by the property owners with access to the utility via a monthly utility service fee. It is important to note, that under the OAVI model, the utility service is virtualized infrastructure.\nServices such as the Internet are delivered across the OAVI with an agreement between the provider and the end user. In this instance the end user is the service provider\u2019s customer. When the end user desires a service other than his or her own, the OAVI model puts the end user in the middle of the network service provider and the infrastructure owner, thereby improving consumer choice and control.\nWatching the video below on Ammon\u2019s model is well worth your time, it explains Ammon\u2019s model and applications as well.\nQuestion: What are the benefits of broadband initiatives across rural America?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

{"prompt":"Challenges faced [15 mins]\nIn my life so far I have started multiple efforts, given up on too many and completed very few. I have often thought about what is it that makes me \u201cshow up\u201d each day for the fulfilment of certain objectives but not others? Why do some objectives matter more than others? What is the best way to figure out what matters to me and why? I\u2019ve written quite a bit about ideas of \u201cChul\u201d and the benefits of understanding the reception conviction of your colleagues.\nIn 2014 for the first time I sat down to write what mattered to me and why? I found that introspection was very challenging, eventually after much struggle I concluded back then that \u201caligning incentives of driven and capable people with positive character traits (specifically the traits include: zest, grit, curiosity, optimism, self control, gratitude and social intelligence) matters to me because I want to live an incredible life but I don\u2019t want my work to become a source of stress for my family, my colleagues, my customers or my partners.\u201d\nLiving an incredible life meant dedicating all my energies to solving a really big problem that I care about and creating an a**-hole proof environment in the process.\n2015 turned out to be an incredible year of self discovery. I came across the work of Ken Robinson who describes ways through which anyone can \u201cfind their element\u201d. For Ken, our element is where talent meets passion. But is passion static? are talents static? I don\u2019t think so. If talent and passion keeps evolving then so does our element. Considering our element keeps evolving, the same must be true for other human beings who collaborate with us to help achieve certain objectives.\nFor me, the answer of what mattered to me and why evolved as well. What I wrote in 2014 is still true, but it still is a means to an end. I have spent the past 2.5 years continuing to write down iterations of the same question and as of today I think levelling the playing field for all consciousness matters to me, but specifically what that\u2019s now boiled down to is the following:\nI want to dedicate my time and energy to join efforts through which I can significantly accelerate the following outcomes: a) make internet access free, b) make electricity access abundant \/ free and c) make financial capital abundant.\nI believe the above 3 outcomes will happen irrespective of my efforts, I simply want to join conversations where the above 3 goals are a core focus. My hypothesis is that I will find beautiful minds across the globe if I join such conversations. After all, we are the \u201caverage of 5 people we spend most of our time with\u201d and so the likelihood of me pushing up my average by talking to people who intend solving audacious goals is quite high\nMy journey has taught me that passions are not static. They evolve and that\u2019s a problem to some extent for leaders and founders in particular because passions only get tested when the going gets tough. Often what separates success stories from failures is grit and persistence.\nI believe that as entrepreneurs when we declare a commitment to a vision, we are making a statement about our passions and our convictions. It is the quality of our introspection that ensures authenticity of our stated purpose, and in my view determines the likelihood of our success.\nAs such, I turned to technology and research to improve the quality of my introspection\nQuestion: What is the main problem with the current state of mobile networks?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

For context, in the 1930s, 9\/10 households did not have to access to electricity in America. By early 1970s, 98% of all rural farms had electrical service. The catalyst to this rapid infrastructure deployment was an incredible piece of legislation called the Rural Electrification Act of 1936.\nThe REA used federal funds to create electric cooperatives which used local labor to build out and maintain electricity infrastructure. In addition, REA hired advisors like Louisan Mamer (1910\u20132005) to show people how to use electricity.\nToday about 900 electric cooperatives serve 56 percent of geographic America, despite accounting for only 11% of total electricity distribution revenues across the United States. Last week I got to meet individuals working for entities that were created as a result of the REA.

You might think this is a nice, utopian but very expensive idea. I think otherwise. However, before going any further into why I think my goal is achievable without any major infrastructure spending program or technological breakthrough for that matter, I want us to be clear on what the internet is\u2026.\nIn an age of instantaneous data transfers and magical handheld devices, it\u2019s easy to forget that the internet is physical. The internet is made up of fiber optic cables, data centers, massive co location centers like 60 Hudson Street in New York, servers, routers, cell phone towers, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and virtually any physical medium that allows data to be stored and transferred from one point to another using the TCP\/IP protocol.\nMost of this internet infrastructure is owned or leased by private enterprises. When you run a google search on your smartphone, you are accessing this infrastructure, and at month end when you make a payment to your mobile network operator or internet service provider you are indirectly paying a toll or fee required to access this internet infrastructure. Such tolls and fees help mobile network operators and internet infrastructure owners cover their own costs and earn a financial return as well.\nThe earliest known internet infrastructure was paid for by the US Government to make powerful computers more accessible to American researcher. Back then, accessing the internet was free for researchers, and expansion of internet infrastructure was centrally coordinated. Then in 1995 the US Govt owned infrastructure got privatized. In the same year the GSMA got established, which stands today as the largest global trade body of mobile network operators.

{"prompt":"1. Broadband is not a partisan issue\nTune into CNN or Fox News and it seems that Republicans and Democrats are ready to annihilate each other. There is no doubt that America is more polarized today than years past but when it comes to bringing high quality internet access to ignored areas, political ideologies become secondary.\nSeveral presenters shared this view but the session which provided richer insights was the one hosted by Deborah and James Fallows. The Fallows shared findings from their travels across smaller towns one normally doesn\u2019t hear about (see map below). The Fallows emphasized that the key ingredient which ensures collaboration across the aisle is mutual respect.\nDeborah shared that she often found herself near a library in the evening as quite often only libraries had internet access and librarians were kind enough to leave WiFi on. The more interesting comment was about the homeless: Deborah shared that many homeless people said that it\u2019s only at libraries where they get respect and that\u2019s why they often congregate there.\nAvenues to explore based on this theme: identify conferences where city and local government officials from different countries can get an opportunity to learn from one another.

{"prompt":"While electronic equipment on cell towers in not being shared at present, it is continuing to become a lot more energy efficient and smaller in size as well. Just like mainframe computers morphed into laptops and tablets, the same trend is playing out in the world of wireless communication equipment. So while the cell towers or the power capacity attached to those towers is staying the same size, the equipment which gets installed on them is becoming a lot smaller and energy efficient.\nEven using the older larger telecom equipment as a proxy, I can tell you that most cell towers have the capacity to accommodate twice as much electronic equipment as they do today.\nThe larger implication is that by renting out a little bit of space on cell towers which is not getting used to begin with, combined with energy efficient small size electronic equipment, while utilizing the immense computing capacity available in billions of smart phones, a company or cooperative could theoretically create a connectivity service that is a lot cheaper than any alternative simply because this new service I speak of would not have to build infrastructure to get coverage in the first place and will not be held back by highly bureaucratic processes either.\nA good example is FabFi, which is a wireless internet network made by MIT\u2019s FabLab in Jalalabad Afghanistan using trash in 2010. This network remains one of the cheapest wireless networks ever built. If instead of trash, what if FabFi equipment could be installed on small little rented spaces on towers across the globe? Could such an idea help make internet access affordable and ubiquitous?\nQuestion: What are the benefits of OAVI?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

{"prompt":"Pathways explored [25 mins]\nWhat gets measured gets done, what gets rewarded gets done repeatedly\nWhen I genuinely started introspecting, I found the process of introspection to be quite flawed and prevailing academic literature seemed to suggest the same. So about 2 years I decided to measure my daily activity by installing a highly invasive application on my computer and smartphone, called Desktime\nMeasuring exactly how I was spending my time in 2014 helped me get a better sense of the delta between my actions and stated beliefs. So in 2015, I started pushing for change and initiated a process through which I could extract myself from my commitments in order to focus on what was really important. I found that measurement solidified my conviction and helped me follow through on actions which some of my friends thought were a bit \u201coutrageous\u201d. They felt this simply because I had a rather \u201cstable \/ well paying job\u201d.\nAs preparation for this talk, I decided to do a literature review and found an excellent paper that was published on HBR which captures my thought process in a much better way.\nQuestion: What are the benefits of OAVI?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}
{"prompt":"To some extent yes, but a global FabFi type wireless network will require access to something called spectrum. Spectrum is basically airwaves which are used by mobile network operators, TV stations and radio stations to transmit signals. Some spectrum like the one used by Wi-Fi routers or Bluetooth devices is free to use, most of it though, is allocated through auctions by governments. Governments have been known to charge as much as possible for licensing spectrum, and this desire to maximize spectrum price is a major factor other than the overlapping infrastructure capacity which keeps cost of connectivity high. The silver lining here is that similar to all other pieces of internet infrastructure, spectrum can also be shared.\nA great example of a product using amateur spectrum on a shared basis is FireChat, this product is a messenger that works without an internet connection because FireChat creates a network of smart phones. If a quarter of people in this hall had FireChat installed and were equally spread out, I could send a message all the way to the back of the hall through FireChat without switching on my data service.\nQuestion: 1.

Joe said that if SandyNet has an operational or service issue, he starts getting messages immediately from people he sees all the time at the grocery store, at school or at any community event. The case of SandyNet is quite inspiring especially considering the city of Sandy has a population of under 10,000!\nInstead of giving dividends to stockholders, SandyNet focuses on keeping prices low for residents.

March 2016), a good friend joked with me saying he always knew I was a \u201ccommie\u201d and reminded me of this quote by Vladimir Lenin (1920).\nSoon after reading this quote I became curious about how America (the anti-thesis of communism) solved its electricity access problem. For context, in the 1930s, 9\/10 households did not have to access to electricity in America. By early 1970s, 98% of all rural farms had electrical service. The catalyst to this rapid infrastructure deployment was an incredible piece of legislation called the Rural Electrification Act of 1936.\nThe REA used federal funds to create electric cooperatives which used local labor to build out and maintain electricity infrastructure. In addition, REA hired advisors like Louisan Mamer (1910\u20132005) to show people how to use electricity.\nToday about 900 electric cooperatives serve 56 percent of geographic America, despite accounting for only 11% of total electricity distribution revenues across the United States. Last week I got to meet individuals working for entities that were created as a result of the REA.

{"prompt":"Thousands of years ago many different tribes lived along the Yellow River in China. Many of them depended on the river for survival and prosperity, but all of them also suffered from periodical floods and draughts. No tribe could do anything because each of them controlled just one section of the river. Eventually all these tribes came together to form the Chinese nation which got an opportunity to control the entire length of the Yellow River. This coming together of tribes allowed the Chinese nation to bring thousands of people together to build canals and dams in order to regulate the river and prevent the worst floods or draughts.\nToday, in the words of my favorite historian, \u201cwe are all living alongside the same cyber river, and no single nation can regulate this river by itself\u201d.

{"prompt":"Challenges faced [15 mins]\nIn my life so far I have started multiple efforts, given up on too many and completed very few. I have often thought about what is it that makes me \u201cshow up\u201d each day for the fulfilment of certain objectives but not others? Why do some objectives matter more than others? What is the best way to figure out what matters to me and why? I\u2019ve written quite a bit about ideas of \u201cChul\u201d and the benefits of understanding the reception conviction of your colleagues.\nIn 2014 for the first time I sat down to write what mattered to me and why? I found that introspection was very challenging, eventually after much struggle I concluded back then that \u201caligning incentives of driven and capable people with positive character traits (specifically the traits include: zest, grit, curiosity, optimism, self control, gratitude and social intelligence) matters to me because I want to live an incredible life but I don\u2019t want my work to become a source of stress for my family, my colleagues, my customers or my partners.\u201d\nLiving an incredible life meant dedicating all my energies to solving a really big problem that I care about and creating an a**-hole proof environment in the process.\n2015 turned out to be an incredible year of self discovery. I came across the work of Ken Robinson who describes ways through which anyone can \u201cfind their element\u201d. For Ken, our element is where talent meets passion. But is passion static? are talents static? I don\u2019t think so. If talent and passion keeps evolving then so does our element. Considering our element keeps evolving, the same must be true for other human beings who collaborate with us to help achieve certain objectives.\nFor me, the answer of what mattered to me and why evolved as well. What I wrote in 2014 is still true, but it still is a means to an end. I have spent the past 2.5 years continuing to write down iterations of the same question and as of today I think levelling the playing field for all consciousness matters to me, but specifically what that\u2019s now boiled down to is the following:\nI want to dedicate my time and energy to join efforts through which I can significantly accelerate the following outcomes: a) make internet access free, b) make electricity access abundant \/ free and c) make financial capital abundant.\nI believe the above 3 outcomes will happen irrespective of my efforts, I simply want to join conversations where the above 3 goals are a core focus. My hypothesis is that I will find beautiful minds across the globe if I join such conversations. After all, we are the \u201caverage of 5 people we spend most of our time with\u201d and so the likelihood of me pushing up my average by talking to people who intend solving audacious goals is quite high\nMy journey has taught me that passions are not static. They evolve and that\u2019s a problem to some extent for leaders and founders in particular because passions only get tested when the going gets tough. Often what separates success stories from failures is grit and persistence.\nI believe that as entrepreneurs when we declare a commitment to a vision, we are making a statement about our passions and our convictions. It is the quality of our introspection that ensures authenticity of our stated purpose, and in my view determines the likelihood of our success.\nAs such, I turned to technology and research to improve the quality of my introspection\nQuestion: What did the author learn from reading two books?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

{"prompt":"3. \u201cIf you build it, they will come\u201d is a fallacy, spelling out impact and describing applications is essential\nBuilding open access infrastructure is just one part of the equation, spelling out precisely what infrastructure can do increases stakeholder alignment. Not every application can be envisioned from the get go but allocating time to imagine applications and quantify benefits increase likelihood of success. Katie Espeseth, VP of New Products at Electric Power Board (EPB) presented Chattanooga\u2019s story.\nShe emphasized the need to spell out applications and collaborate with partners to put infrastructure to use. What I loved about Katie\u2019s talk was her focus on impact. She set the stage by sharing a quote from Walter Cronkite (American journalist) who called Chattanooga the \u201cdirtiest city in America\u201d. Through photographs she showed how Chattanooga has left behind its dirty city legacy and has now become \u201cGig city\u201d (i.e. city offering gigabit speed internet access).\nMy favorite example from Katie\u2019s talk was about how high schools students in Chattanooga are able to experience biology and STEM like never before because their fiber network allows for high resolution imagery to get transmitted at very low latency levels. This video shows how students in Chattanooga are learning from a professor based in California while getting to operate a powerful microscope using a mouse thanks in part to a fiber network.\nAvenues to explore based on this theme: quantify economic and financial impact resulting from large scale fiber deployments on utility infrastructure.

However, just noticing the data throughput capability of optical modules over time shows an exponential curve. Considering data consumption grows exponentially as well, fiber as a transport medium seems to be an obvious choice.\nQuestion: What advice would the author give to first time directors?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

{"prompt":"I want to make internet access affordable for all because I think everyone should have the ability to ask a question and get a straight answer. You might think this is a nice, utopian but very expensive idea. I think otherwise. However, before going any further into why I think my goal is achievable without any major infrastructure spending program or technological breakthrough for that matter, I want us to be clear on what the internet is\u2026.\nIn an age of instantaneous data transfers and magical handheld devices, it\u2019s easy to forget that the internet is physical. The internet is made up of fiber optic cables, data centers, massive co location centers like 60 Hudson Street in New York, servers, routers, cell phone towers, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and virtually any physical medium that allows data to be stored and transferred from one point to another using the TCP\/IP protocol.\nMost of this internet infrastructure is owned or leased by private enterprises. When you run a google search on your smartphone, you are accessing this infrastructure, and at month end when you make a payment to your mobile network operator or internet service provider you are indirectly paying a toll or fee required to access this internet infrastructure. Such tolls and fees help mobile network operators and internet infrastructure owners cover their own costs and earn a financial return as well.\nThe earliest known internet infrastructure was paid for by the US Government to make powerful computers more accessible to American researcher. Back then, accessing the internet was free for researchers, and expansion of internet infrastructure was centrally coordinated. Then in 1995 the US Govt owned infrastructure got privatized. In the same year the GSMA got established, which stands today as the largest global trade body of mobile network operators. The GSMA helped in creating standards which enabled the launch of SMS, Data and Fax services over wireless networks.\nQuestion: 1.

{"prompt":"To some extent yes, but a global FabFi type wireless network will require access to something called spectrum. Spectrum is basically airwaves which are used by mobile network operators, TV stations and radio stations to transmit signals. Some spectrum like the one used by Wi-Fi routers or Bluetooth devices is free to use, most of it though, is allocated through auctions by governments. Governments have been known to charge as much as possible for licensing spectrum, and this desire to maximize spectrum price is a major factor other than the overlapping infrastructure capacity which keeps cost of connectivity high. The silver lining here is that similar to all other pieces of internet infrastructure, spectrum can also be shared.\nA great example of a product using amateur spectrum on a shared basis is FireChat, this product is a messenger that works without an internet connection because FireChat creates a network of smart phones. If a quarter of people in this hall had FireChat installed and were equally spread out, I could send a message all the way to the back of the hall through FireChat without switching on my data service.\nQuestion: How can being gentle and loving towards other life become the most important thing we do?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

You might think this is a nice, utopian but very expensive idea. I think otherwise. However, before going any further into why I think my goal is achievable without any major infrastructure spending program or technological breakthrough for that matter, I want us to be clear on what the internet is\u2026.\nIn an age of instantaneous data transfers and magical handheld devices, it\u2019s easy to forget that the internet is physical. The internet is made up of fiber optic cables, data centers, massive co location centers like 60 Hudson Street in New York, servers, routers, cell phone towers, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and virtually any physical medium that allows data to be stored and transferred from one point to another using the TCP\/IP protocol.\nMost of this internet infrastructure is owned or leased by private enterprises. When you run a google search on your smartphone, you are accessing this infrastructure, and at month end when you make a payment to your mobile network operator or internet service provider you are indirectly paying a toll or fee required to access this internet infrastructure. Such tolls and fees help mobile network operators and internet infrastructure owners cover their own costs and earn a financial return as well.\nThe earliest known internet infrastructure was paid for by the US Government to make powerful computers more accessible to American researcher. Back then, accessing the internet was free for researchers, and expansion of internet infrastructure was centrally coordinated. Then in 1995 the US Govt owned infrastructure got privatized. In the same year the GSMA got established, which stands today as the largest global trade body of mobile network operators. The GSMA helped in creating standards which enabled the launch of SMS, Data and Fax services over wireless networks.\nQuestion: Who tends to be the most influential or loudest voice during board meetings?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

{"prompt":"While electronic equipment on cell towers in not being shared at present, it is continuing to become a lot more energy efficient and smaller in size as well. Just like mainframe computers morphed into laptops and tablets, the same trend is playing out in the world of wireless communication equipment. So while the cell towers or the power capacity attached to those towers is staying the same size, the equipment which gets installed on them is becoming a lot smaller and energy efficient.\nEven using the older larger telecom equipment as a proxy, I can tell you that most cell towers have the capacity to accommodate twice as much electronic equipment as they do today.\nThe larger implication is that by renting out a little bit of space on cell towers which is not getting used to begin with, combined with energy efficient small size electronic equipment, while utilizing the immense computing capacity available in billions of smart phones, a company or cooperative could theoretically create a connectivity service that is a lot cheaper than any alternative simply because this new service I speak of would not have to build infrastructure to get coverage in the first place and will not be held back by highly bureaucratic processes either.\nA good example is FabFi, which is a wireless internet network made by MIT\u2019s FabLab in Jalalabad Afghanistan using trash in 2010. This network remains one of the cheapest wireless networks ever built. If instead of trash, what if FabFi equipment could be installed on small little rented spaces on towers across the globe?

No tribe could do anything because each of them controlled just one section of the river.

March 2016), a good friend joked with me saying he always knew I was a \u201ccommie\u201d and reminded me of this quote by Vladimir Lenin (1920).\nSoon after reading this quote I became curious about how America (the anti-thesis of communism) solved its electricity access problem. For context, in the 1930s, 9\/10 households did not have to access to electricity in America. By early 1970s, 98% of all rural farms had electrical service. The catalyst to this rapid infrastructure deployment was an incredible piece of legislation called the Rural Electrification Act of 1936.\nThe REA used federal funds to create electric cooperatives which used local labor to build out and maintain electricity infrastructure. In addition, REA hired advisors like Louisan Mamer (1910\u20132005) to show people how to use electricity.\nToday about 900 electric cooperatives serve 56 percent of geographic America, despite accounting for only 11% of total electricity distribution revenues across the United States. Last week I got to meet individuals working for entities that were created as a result of the REA. Many of them are now focused on bringing high speed Internet to their communities because telephone and cable corporations are not incentivized to build infrastructure in sparsely populated areas.\nWhile listening to presenters who have mobilized local governments and communities to build broadband infrastructure, I observed the following themes:\nQuestion: 1.

{"prompt":"Challenges faced [15 mins]\nIn my life so far I have started multiple efforts, given up on too many and completed very few. I have often thought about what is it that makes me \u201cshow up\u201d each day for the fulfilment of certain objectives but not others? Why do some objectives matter more than others? What is the best way to figure out what matters to me and why? I\u2019ve written quite a bit about ideas of \u201cChul\u201d and the benefits of understanding the reception conviction of your colleagues.\nIn 2014 for the first time I sat down to write what mattered to me and why? I found that introspection was very challenging, eventually after much struggle I concluded back then that \u201caligning incentives of driven and capable people with positive character traits (specifically the traits include: zest, grit, curiosity, optimism, self control, gratitude and social intelligence) matters to me because I want to live an incredible life but I don\u2019t want my work to become a source of stress for my family, my colleagues, my customers or my partners.\u201d\nLiving an incredible life meant dedicating all my energies to solving a really big problem that I care about and creating an a**-hole proof environment in the process.\n2015 turned out to be an incredible year of self discovery. I came across the work of Ken Robinson who describes ways through which anyone can \u201cfind their element\u201d. For Ken, our element is where talent meets passion. But is passion static? are talents static? I don\u2019t think so. If talent and passion keeps evolving then so does our element. Considering our element keeps evolving, the same must be true for other human beings who collaborate with us to help achieve certain objectives.\nFor me, the answer of what mattered to me and why evolved as well. What I wrote in 2014 is still true, but it still is a means to an end. I have spent the past 2.5 years continuing to write down iterations of the same question and as of today I think levelling the playing field for all consciousness matters to me, but specifically what that\u2019s now boiled down to is the following:\nI want to dedicate my time and energy to join efforts through which I can significantly accelerate the following outcomes: a) make internet access free, b) make electricity access abundant \/ free and c) make financial capital abundant.\nI believe the above 3 outcomes will happen irrespective of my efforts, I simply want to join conversations where the above 3 goals are a core focus. My hypothesis is that I will find beautiful minds across the globe if I join such conversations. After all, we are the \u201caverage of 5 people we spend most of our time with\u201d and so the likelihood of me pushing up my average by talking to people who intend solving audacious goals is quite high\nMy journey has taught me that passions are not static. They evolve and that\u2019s a problem to some extent for leaders and founders in particular because passions only get tested when the going gets tough. Often what separates success stories from failures is grit and persistence.\nI believe that as entrepreneurs when we declare a commitment to a vision, we are making a statement about our passions and our convictions. It is the quality of our introspection that ensures authenticity of our stated purpose, and in my view determines the likelihood of our success.\nAs such, I turned to technology and research to improve the quality of my introspection\nQuestion: 1.

When you run a google search on your smartphone, you are accessing this infrastructure, and at month end when you make a payment to your mobile network operator or internet service provider you are indirectly paying a toll or fee required to access this internet infrastructure. Such tolls and fees help mobile network operators and internet infrastructure owners cover their own costs and earn a financial return as well.\nThe earliest known internet infrastructure was paid for by the US Government to make powerful computers more accessible to American researcher. Back then, accessing the internet was free for researchers, and expansion of internet infrastructure was centrally coordinated. Then in 1995 the US Govt owned infrastructure got privatized. In the same year the GSMA got established, which stands today as the largest global trade body of mobile network operators. The GSMA helped in creating standards which enabled the launch of SMS, Data and Fax services over wireless networks.\nQuestion: 1.

{"prompt":"Challenges faced [15 mins]\nIn my life so far I have started multiple efforts, given up on too many and completed very few. I have often thought about what is it that makes me \u201cshow up\u201d each day for the fulfilment of certain objectives but not others? Why do some objectives matter more than others? What is the best way to figure out what matters to me and why? I\u2019ve written quite a bit about ideas of \u201cChul\u201d and the benefits of understanding the reception conviction of your colleagues.\nIn 2014 for the first time I sat down to write what mattered to me and why? I found that introspection was very challenging, eventually after much struggle I concluded back then that \u201caligning incentives of driven and capable people with positive character traits (specifically the traits include: zest, grit, curiosity, optimism, self control, gratitude and social intelligence) matters to me because I want to live an incredible life but I don\u2019t want my work to become a source of stress for my family, my colleagues, my customers or my partners.\u201d\nLiving an incredible life meant dedicating all my energies to solving a really big problem that I care about and creating an a**-hole proof environment in the process.\n2015 turned out to be an incredible year of self discovery. I came across the work of Ken Robinson who describes ways through which anyone can \u201cfind their element\u201d. For Ken, our element is where talent meets passion. But is passion static? are talents static? I don\u2019t think so. If talent and passion keeps evolving then so does our element. Considering our element keeps evolving, the same must be true for other human beings who collaborate with us to help achieve certain objectives.\nFor me, the answer of what mattered to me and why evolved as well. What I wrote in 2014 is still true, but it still is a means to an end. I have spent the past 2.5 years continuing to write down iterations of the same question and as of today I think levelling the playing field for all consciousness matters to me, but specifically what that\u2019s now boiled down to is the following:\nI want to dedicate my time and energy to join efforts through which I can significantly accelerate the following outcomes: a) make internet access free, b) make electricity access abundant \/ free and c) make financial capital abundant.\nI believe the above 3 outcomes will happen irrespective of my efforts, I simply want to join conversations where the above 3 goals are a core focus. My hypothesis is that I will find beautiful minds across the globe if I join such conversations. After all, we are the \u201caverage of 5 people we spend most of our time with\u201d and so the likelihood of me pushing up my average by talking to people who intend solving audacious goals is quite high\nMy journey has taught me that passions are not static. They evolve and that\u2019s a problem to some extent for leaders and founders in particular because passions only get tested when the going gets tough. Often what separates success stories from failures is grit and persistence.\nI believe that as entrepreneurs when we declare a commitment to a vision, we are making a statement about our passions and our convictions. It is the quality of our introspection that ensures authenticity of our stated purpose, and in my view determines the likelihood of our success.\nAs such, I turned to technology and research to improve the quality of my introspection\nQuestion: How many people raised their hands when she asked how many of them had done something borderline illegal before the age of 23?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

However, you have to get the first few moves right. I am convinced that making internet access affordable for all is an optimal first move.

Many of them depended on the river for survival and prosperity, but all of them also suffered from periodical floods and draughts. No tribe could do anything because each of them controlled just one section of the river.

This coming together of tribes allowed the Chinese nation to bring thousands of people together to build canals and dams in order to regulate the river and prevent the worst floods or draughts.\nToday, in the words of my favorite historian, \u201cwe are all living alongside the same cyber river, and no single nation can regulate this river by itself\u201d.

{"prompt":"This intersection of internet infrastructure privatization and launch of wireless services worldwide created a gold rush of sorts because selling connectivity services without laying down cables or wires seemed like an attractive idea to investors in telecom companies. This also meant that many telecom companies offering virtually identical services would end up building excess and overlapping infrastructure to win over customers.\nFor example, when mobile network operators started building out their respective wireless networks around the world, they made a conscious decision not to share cell towers because in the early days of network roll outs, coverage was viewed as a competitive advantage. A mobile network operator with presence in 60 cities was a more promising story than one with presence in 50 cities. Thus, mobile network operators often constructed cell towers right next to each other and this choice led to a scenario which was equivalent to a country building 4 to 5 overlapping highways that could not connect with one another.\nQuestion: What did Nathan Rosenberg say about fiber?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

{"prompt":"OAVI enhances consumer choice by separating the underlying physical infrastructure from the network services. Each end user is empowered by being presented with his own infrastructure. As a result, every user has the ability to receive and\/or deliver services across the infrastructure by utilizing a self provisioned network or by joining a network provided by any other user by joint agreement. Here is how the financial model works:\nWithin the municipal framework, utility infrastructure build costs are paid by the property owners desiring the utility service. This could be done via a standard municipal bond process which requires the support of the property owners who will receive the utility service.\nThe utility infrastructure maintenance and operational costs are paid by the property owners with access to the utility via a monthly utility service fee. It is important to note, that under the OAVI model, the utility service is virtualized infrastructure.\nServices such as the Internet are delivered across the OAVI with an agreement between the provider and the end user. In this instance the end user is the service provider\u2019s customer. When the end user desires a service other than his or her own, the OAVI model puts the end user in the middle of the network service provider and the infrastructure owner, thereby improving consumer choice and control.\nWatching the video below on Ammon\u2019s model is well worth your time, it explains Ammon\u2019s model and applications as well.\nQuestion: 1.

March 2016), a good friend joked with me saying he always knew I was a \u201ccommie\u201d and reminded me of this quote by Vladimir Lenin (1920).\nSoon after reading this quote I became curious about how America (the anti-thesis of communism) solved its electricity access problem. For context, in the 1930s, 9\/10 households did not have to access to electricity in America. By early 1970s, 98% of all rural farms had electrical service. The catalyst to this rapid infrastructure deployment was an incredible piece of legislation called the Rural Electrification Act of 1936.\nThe REA used federal funds to create electric cooperatives which used local labor to build out and maintain electricity infrastructure. In addition, REA hired advisors like Louisan Mamer (1910\u20132005) to show people how to use electricity.\nToday about 900 electric cooperatives serve 56 percent of geographic America, despite accounting for only 11% of total electricity distribution revenues across the United States. Last week I got to meet individuals working for entities that were created as a result of the REA. Many of them are now focused on bringing high speed Internet to their communities because telephone and cable corporations are not incentivized to build infrastructure in sparsely populated areas.\nWhile listening to presenters who have mobilized local governments and communities to build broadband infrastructure, I observed the following themes:\nQuestion: Why is it hard to love the self?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

Spectrum is basically airwaves which are used by mobile network operators, TV stations and radio stations to transmit signals. Some spectrum like the one used by Wi-Fi routers or Bluetooth devices is free to use, most of it though, is allocated through auctions by governments. Governments have been known to charge as much as possible for licensing spectrum, and this desire to maximize spectrum price is a major factor other than the overlapping infrastructure capacity which keeps cost of connectivity high. The silver lining here is that similar to all other pieces of internet infrastructure, spectrum can also be shared.\nA great example of a product using amateur spectrum on a shared basis is FireChat, this product is a messenger that works without an internet connection because FireChat creates a network of smart phones.

You might think this is a nice, utopian but very expensive idea. I think otherwise. However, before going any further into why I think my goal is achievable without any major infrastructure spending program or technological breakthrough for that matter, I want us to be clear on what the internet is\u2026.\nIn an age of instantaneous data transfers and magical handheld devices, it\u2019s easy to forget that the internet is physical. The internet is made up of fiber optic cables, data centers, massive co location centers like 60 Hudson Street in New York, servers, routers, cell phone towers, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and virtually any physical medium that allows data to be stored and transferred from one point to another using the TCP\/IP protocol.\nMost of this internet infrastructure is owned or leased by private enterprises. When you run a google search on your smartphone, you are accessing this infrastructure, and at month end when you make a payment to your mobile network operator or internet service provider you are indirectly paying a toll or fee required to access this internet infrastructure. Such tolls and fees help mobile network operators and internet infrastructure owners cover their own costs and earn a financial return as well.\nThe earliest known internet infrastructure was paid for by the US Government to make powerful computers more accessible to American researcher.

However, before going any further into why I think my goal is achievable without any major infrastructure spending program or technological breakthrough for that matter, I want us to be clear on what the internet is\u2026.\nIn an age of instantaneous data transfers and magical handheld devices, it\u2019s easy to forget that the internet is physical. The internet is made up of fiber optic cables, data centers, massive co location centers like 60 Hudson Street in New York, servers, routers, cell phone towers, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and virtually any physical medium that allows data to be stored and transferred from one point to another using the TCP\/IP protocol.\nMost of this internet infrastructure is owned or leased by private enterprises. When you run a google search on your smartphone, you are accessing this infrastructure, and at month end when you make a payment to your mobile network operator or internet service provider you are indirectly paying a toll or fee required to access this internet infrastructure. Such tolls and fees help mobile network operators and internet infrastructure owners cover their own costs and earn a financial return as well.\nThe earliest known internet infrastructure was paid for by the US Government to make powerful computers more accessible to American researcher.

Yet, we live in a situation where half the world population cannot get online largely because they cannot afford to pay the tolls and fees needed to access this information highway.\nThe silver lining though is that many of these overbuilt highways I speak of are under utilized, meaning capacity clearly exists to accommodate a lot more traffic.

{"prompt":"So clearly we have a situation where the technology and infrastructure capacity both exist to reduce the cost of internet access, but such technologies are not well distributed. Why?\n\nPrimarily because mobile network operators have created an inflated cost base which makes it impossible to provide internet services to less affluent communities, but also because FabFi like solutions appear quite technical in nature. Good thing is that already there are many companies consciously innovating to make wireless communication equipment a lot more modular and user friendly.

{"prompt":"This intersection of internet infrastructure privatization and launch of wireless services worldwide created a gold rush of sorts because selling connectivity services without laying down cables or wires seemed like an attractive idea to investors in telecom companies. This also meant that many telecom companies offering virtually identical services would end up building excess and overlapping infrastructure to win over customers.\nFor example, when mobile network operators started building out their respective wireless networks around the world, they made a conscious decision not to share cell towers because in the early days of network roll outs, coverage was viewed as a competitive advantage. A mobile network operator with presence in 60 cities was a more promising story than one with presence in 50 cities. Thus, mobile network operators often constructed cell towers right next to each other and this choice led to a scenario which was equivalent to a country building 4 to 5 overlapping highways that could not connect with one another.\nQuestion: Why do people proclaim that they want to make the world a better place, but rarely talk about their need to be loved?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

Katie Espeseth, VP of New Products at Electric Power Board (EPB) presented Chattanooga\u2019s story.\nShe emphasized the need to spell out applications and collaborate with partners to put infrastructure to use. What I loved about Katie\u2019s talk was her focus on impact.

I don\u2019t think so. Can anyone feel relevance without recognition?\n\nWhy then do I grudge another for craving recognition?\n\nWhy is it so hard to love insecure people?\n\nWhy must we hate insecurities? Why must I hate insecurities?\n\nInterestingly I\u2019ve found that love is an element of abundance. People who love the most number of other people also get the most most amount of love back. Such people also don\u2019t find it hard to love themselves. A loving environment minimizes the chances of triggering or creating more insecurities, thereby reducing the desire for people to seek recognition, thereby helping share relevance more easily with more people.\n\nCan being gentle and loving towards other life become the most important thing we do?\nQuestion: How does FabFi provide wireless internet access?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

I found myself often thinking \u201cwow I don\u2019t belong here\u201d or \u201chow on earth did I get here\u201d. That insecurity often leads to unnatural behavior which is usually guided by pleasing the popular opinion in the room. That\u2019s exactly what one must not do. Instead I found that holding my own and sharing what my authentic self truly thought proved most valuable for stakeholders involved.\n\n6. Your duty is towards all stakeholders and not just shareholders\nDirectors are appointed by shareholders and shareholders can fire directors. This often leads to a view, as it did with me, that allegiance is solely with shareholders. Such a view is shortsighted because unless all stakeholders, particularly Management, believe that everyone is playing on the same team, incentives can never be aligned. Therefore, optimizing asks for shareholders alone is often a recipe for disaster.\nQuestion: What are the implications of this technology?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

{"prompt":"While electronic equipment on cell towers in not being shared at present, it is continuing to become a lot more energy efficient and smaller in size as well. Just like mainframe computers morphed into laptops and tablets, the same trend is playing out in the world of wireless communication equipment. So while the cell towers or the power capacity attached to those towers is staying the same size, the equipment which gets installed on them is becoming a lot smaller and energy efficient.\nEven using the older larger telecom equipment as a proxy, I can tell you that most cell towers have the capacity to accommodate twice as much electronic equipment as they do today.\nThe larger implication is that by renting out a little bit of space on cell towers which is not getting used to begin with, combined with energy efficient small size electronic equipment, while utilizing the immense computing capacity available in billions of smart phones, a company or cooperative could theoretically create a connectivity service that is a lot cheaper than any alternative simply because this new service I speak of would not have to build infrastructure to get coverage in the first place and will not be held back by highly bureaucratic processes either.\nA good example is FabFi, which is a wireless internet network made by MIT\u2019s FabLab in Jalalabad Afghanistan using trash in 2010. This network remains one of the cheapest wireless networks ever built. If instead of trash, what if FabFi equipment could be installed on small little rented spaces on towers across the globe? Could such an idea help make internet access affordable and ubiquitous?\nQuestion: 1.

However, you have to get the first few moves right. I am convinced that making internet access affordable for all is an optimal first move.

{"prompt":"I got appointed as a director on a company\u2019s board of directors for the first time in January 2012, I was 29 years old and had heard the term fiduciary duty for the very first time.\nThe company in question was Inbox Business Technologies, Pakistan\u2019s largest system integrator \/ technology services company by revenue. My appointment happened because Dawood Hercules Group (DH) owned a majority stake in Inbox and I was working with DH to launch a private equity firm called Cyan.\nI remember being overwhelmed, not knowing where to turn for advice. The existing set of directors who I had interacted with didn\u2019t have a uniform understanding of what it meant to be a good director. So I naturally turned to the web as I do for everything else. I came across two books I) Boards that Lead and II) CEO\u2019s Boss. While the text was prescriptive and relevant I had a really hard time figuring out how to draw the line between \u201cbeing strategic\u201d and \u201cbeing too operational\u201d.\nIn the years to come DH ended up appointing me on the boards of their most important companies including Engro Corporation and Engro Foods. I\u2019m still not sure what I did right and what I did wrong, unfortunately a method to evaluate a director\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t exist or when it does is rarely implemented. However, I wish there existed a write-up back then for rookie or first time board members. This is that write up and contains some advice for first time directors.\nQuestion: What was the key ingredient which ensured collaboration across the aisle?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

{"prompt":"When I first shared with my friends and family that I will quit my career to make internet access affordable for all (c. March 2016), a good friend joked with me saying he always knew I was a \u201ccommie\u201d and reminded me of this quote by Vladimir Lenin (1920).\nSoon after reading this quote I became curious about how America (the anti-thesis of communism) solved its electricity access problem. For context, in the 1930s, 9\/10 households did not have to access to electricity in America. By early 1970s, 98% of all rural farms had electrical service. The catalyst to this rapid infrastructure deployment was an incredible piece of legislation called the Rural Electrification Act of 1936.\nThe REA used federal funds to create electric cooperatives which used local labor to build out and maintain electricity infrastructure. In addition, REA hired advisors like Louisan Mamer (1910\u20132005) to show people how to use electricity.\nToday about 900 electric cooperatives serve 56 percent of geographic America, despite accounting for only 11% of total electricity distribution revenues across the United States. Last week I got to meet individuals working for entities that were created as a result of the REA. Many of them are now focused on bringing high speed Internet to their communities because telephone and cable corporations are not incentivized to build infrastructure in sparsely populated areas.\nWhile listening to presenters who have mobilized local governments and communities to build broadband infrastructure, I observed the following themes:\nQuestion: What did Deborah share about the homeless?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found to answer the question."}

{"prompt":"Why is relevance so hard to share?\n\nIs relevance finite?\n\nWhy does relevance always come at a cost?\n\nIn a world of scarcity the mind has grown to internalize that anything that really makes us feel good (like the feeling of relevance) must be scarce because hey all good things are scarce. In fact some even think that unless a thing is scarce, it can\u2019t really be good. Is that really the case though? I\u2019m not sure. What do you think?\n\nI think it\u2019s critical that we move towards a world of abundance and start with making the feeling of relevance abundant to all lives we touch (including our own).\n\nWhy do people still try to steal credit for other people\u2019s work in efforts which are truly in everyone\u2019s best interest?

{"prompt":"To some extent yes, but a global FabFi type wireless network will require access to something called spectrum. Spectrum is basically airwaves which are used by mobile network operators, TV stations and radio stations to transmit signals. Some spectrum like the one used by Wi-Fi routers or Bluetooth devices is free to use, most of it though, is allocated through auctions by governments. Governments have been known to charge as much as possible for licensing spectrum, and this desire to maximize spectrum price is a major factor other than the overlapping infrastructure capacity which keeps cost of connectivity high. The silver lining here is that similar to all other pieces of internet infrastructure, spectrum can also be shared.\nA great example of a product using amateur spectrum on a shared basis is FireChat, this product is a messenger that works without an internet connection because FireChat creates a network of smart phones.
