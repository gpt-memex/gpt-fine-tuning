"I got appointed as a director on a company’s board of directors for the first time in January 2012, I was 29 years old and had heard the term fiduciary duty for the very first time.
The company in question was Inbox Business Technologies, Pakistan’s largest system integrator / technology services company by revenue. My appointment happened because Dawood Hercules Group (DH) owned a majority stake in Inbox and I was working with DH to launch a private equity firm called Cyan.
I remember being overwhelmed, not knowing where to turn for advice. The existing set of directors who I had interacted with didn’t have a uniform understanding of what it meant to be a good director. So I naturally turned to the web as I do for everything else. I came across two books I) Boards that Lead and II) CEO’s Boss. While the text was prescriptive and relevant I had a really hard time figuring out how to draw the line between “being strategic” and “being too operational”.
In the years to come DH ended up appointing me on the boards of their most important companies including Engro Corporation and Engro Foods. I’m still not sure what I did right and what I did wrong, unfortunately a method to evaluate a director’s performance doesn’t exist or when it does is rarely implemented. However, I wish there existed a write-up back then for rookie or first time board members. This is that write up and contains some advice for first time directors.",318,"I got appointed as a director on a company’s board of directors for the first time in January 2012, I was 29 years old and had heard the term fiduciary duty for the very first time.

"1. Read the board materials thoroughly and make notes
As obvious as that sounds, at least in my experience I found that most directors at best skimmed through board materials as opposed to a diligent read. This was reflected in many questions they asked which were actually addressed in the pack. Now it is the Management’s job to prepare a precise pack but it’s unfair to put the entire responsibility on Management. Boards need to do their part and it starts with diligent reading, note taking and research.",103,"1. Read the board materials thoroughly and make notes

"2. Invest time in really getting to know the CEO outside the board room
Group mentality really kicks in during board meetings. The most influential or loudest voice often ends up trumping the group’s opinion and that leads to pretty wild swings on opinions related to some very important matters. Getting to know the CEO outside the board room helps in understanding what the board is talking about and what “really needs to be talked about”.

"3. Get to know the company’s customers and competitors
Board meetings are often a one way communication where Management tells the board what’s going on. Very often, boards have no way of verifying whether assumptions proposed by Management are indeed inline with industry norms. Specifically pay attention to situations where company’s performance is not in line with the industry’s. I recall one company I was involved with, in a year where the entire industry made money, the company I was associated with lost money.

"4. “Grilling” Management or “making a point” is not the point
Very often board meetings become an interrogation. There are some nice catch phrases directors will use such as “this is a board room and not a court room”. That said, the hardest part in being a rookie director is in trying really hard to convince others and yourself that you indeed add value. There’s a tendency to start grilling management unnecessarily to show that you add value. I surely did that. I was fortunate to have worked with an amazing CEO who helped me reform and realize that I couldn’t truly get effective if I wasn’t comfortable in my own skin.",144,"4. “Grilling” Management or “making a point” is not the point

"5. Stop trying to justify your presence to yourself
Insecurities kick in for a rookie director in a pretty big way. I found myself often thinking “wow I don’t belong here” or “how on earth did I get here”. That insecurity often leads to unnatural behavior which is usually guided by pleasing the popular opinion in the room. That’s exactly what one must not do. Instead I found that holding my own and sharing what my authentic self truly thought proved most valuable for stakeholders involved.

6. Your duty is towards all stakeholders and not just shareholders
Directors are appointed by shareholders and shareholders can fire directors. This often leads to a view, as it did with me, that allegiance is solely with shareholders. Such a view is shortsighted because unless all stakeholders, particularly Management, believe that everyone is playing on the same team, incentives can never be aligned. Therefore, optimizing asks for shareholders alone is often a recipe for disaster.",200,"5. Stop trying to justify your presence to yourself

"7. Fire the CEO if you feel you must get too “operational”
There’s a thin line between strategic decisions and operational decisions. Pricing a product may be an operational decision for many businesses but the thought process behind setting prices is indeed a strategic decision. Sitting on the sidelines and saying “well I’ve given my input” is not enough. If sh*t is about to hit the fan, then be prepared to roll sleeves and let the CEO know that you are a resource who is available to put up a fight if needed. Too many directors continue to sit on the sidelines because sometimes it’s just too convenient to focus solely on the “big picture”.

8. Insist on director evaluations, if not formalized, ask for your own evaluation after every meeting
I love how Ray Dalio runs his meetings and how participants can rank each other’s input on a set of criterion. The same must be done for board meetings.

"9. Listen to understand and respond as opposed to gloss over and react.
This goes back to insecurities and being worried that “you don’t belong”. Perhaps the worst attribute I’ve seen from directors is being verbose and not listening to understand but instead listening to react. Very often one runs into directors who are there to outshine others and make Management look bad in order to justify their own self worth. Such directors are awful for companies and the only purpose they serve is to satisfy their own fragile egos.

In all my research to understand what makes a good director I ended up finding more questions than answers. I concluded that there’s no right answer.

"Thousands of years ago many different tribes lived along the Yellow River in China. Many of them depended on the river for survival and prosperity, but all of them also suffered from periodical floods and draughts. No tribe could do anything because each of them controlled just one section of the river. Eventually all these tribes came together to form the Chinese nation which got an opportunity to control the entire length of the Yellow River. This coming together of tribes allowed the Chinese nation to bring thousands of people together to build canals and dams in order to regulate the river and prevent the worst floods or draughts.
Today, in the words of my favorite historian, “we are all living alongside the same cyber river, and no single nation can regulate this river by itself”. While I fully agree with Yuval Harari that overcoming present day challenges like climate change will require global coordination, I want to emphasize that the “we” he speaks of, only includes half of us, because even now half the human population cannot afford to access the internet.

"I want to make internet access affordable for all because I think everyone should have the ability to ask a question and get a straight answer. You might think this is a nice, utopian but very expensive idea. I think otherwise. However, before going any further into why I think my goal is achievable without any major infrastructure spending program or technological breakthrough for that matter, I want us to be clear on what the internet is….
In an age of instantaneous data transfers and magical handheld devices, it’s easy to forget that the internet is physical. The internet is made up of fiber optic cables, data centers, massive co location centers like 60 Hudson Street in New York, servers, routers, cell phone towers, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and virtually any physical medium that allows data to be stored and transferred from one point to another using the TCP/IP protocol.
Most of this internet infrastructure is owned or leased by private enterprises. When you run a google search on your smartphone, you are accessing this infrastructure, and at month end when you make a payment to your mobile network operator or internet service provider you are indirectly paying a toll or fee required to access this internet infrastructure. Such tolls and fees help mobile network operators and internet infrastructure owners cover their own costs and earn a financial return as well.
The earliest known internet infrastructure was paid for by the US Government to make powerful computers more accessible to American researcher. Back then, accessing the internet was free for researchers, and expansion of internet infrastructure was centrally coordinated. Then in 1995 the US Govt owned infrastructure got privatized. In the same year the GSMA got established, which stands today as the largest global trade body of mobile network operators. The GSMA helped in creating standards which enabled the launch of SMS, Data and Fax services over wireless networks.",365,"I want to make internet access affordable for all because I think everyone should have the ability to ask a question and get a straight answer.

"This intersection of internet infrastructure privatization and launch of wireless services worldwide created a gold rush of sorts because selling connectivity services without laying down cables or wires seemed like an attractive idea to investors in telecom companies. This also meant that many telecom companies offering virtually identical services would end up building excess and overlapping infrastructure to win over customers.
For example, when mobile network operators started building out their respective wireless networks around the world, they made a conscious decision not to share cell towers because in the early days of network roll outs, coverage was viewed as a competitive advantage. A mobile network operator with presence in 60 cities was a more promising story than one with presence in 50 cities. Thus, mobile network operators often constructed cell towers right next to each other and this choice led to a scenario which was equivalent to a country building 4 to 5 overlapping highways that could not connect with one another.",173,"This intersection of internet infrastructure privatization and launch of wireless services worldwide created a gold rush of sorts because selling connectivity services without laying down cables or wires seemed like an attractive idea to investors in telecom companies.

"To facilitate sharing and remove choke points, infrastructure sharing companies have emerged. An infrastructure sharing company typically buys and leases back a piece of infrastructure like a cell tower to enable sharing. Three mobile network operators sharing one cell tower results in lower operating and maintenance costs for all compared to a situation when one mobile network company uses one tower all by itself. Lowering of operating costs makes it more feasible to serve customers who want to get online but cannot afford to do so.

"While electronic equipment on cell towers in not being shared at present, it is continuing to become a lot more energy efficient and smaller in size as well. Just like mainframe computers morphed into laptops and tablets, the same trend is playing out in the world of wireless communication equipment. So while the cell towers or the power capacity attached to those towers is staying the same size, the equipment which gets installed on them is becoming a lot smaller and energy efficient.
Even using the older larger telecom equipment as a proxy, I can tell you that most cell towers have the capacity to accommodate twice as much electronic equipment as they do today.
The larger implication is that by renting out a little bit of space on cell towers which is not getting used to begin with, combined with energy efficient small size electronic equipment, while utilizing the immense computing capacity available in billions of smart phones, a company or cooperative could theoretically create a connectivity service that is a lot cheaper than any alternative simply because this new service I speak of would not have to build infrastructure to get coverage in the first place and will not be held back by highly bureaucratic processes either.

"To some extent yes, but a global FabFi type wireless network will require access to something called spectrum. Spectrum is basically airwaves which are used by mobile network operators, TV stations and radio stations to transmit signals. Some spectrum like the one used by Wi-Fi routers or Bluetooth devices is free to use, most of it though, is allocated through auctions by governments. Governments have been known to charge as much as possible for licensing spectrum, and this desire to maximize spectrum price is a major factor other than the overlapping infrastructure capacity which keeps cost of connectivity high. The silver lining here is that similar to all other pieces of internet infrastructure, spectrum can also be shared.
A great example of a product using amateur spectrum on a shared basis is FireChat, this product is a messenger that works without an internet connection because FireChat creates a network of smart phones. If a quarter of people in this hall had FireChat installed and were equally spread out, I could send a message all the way to the back of the hall through FireChat without switching on my data service.",214,"To some extent yes, but a global FabFi type wireless network will require access to something called spectrum.

It is important for a global FabFi type wireless network because it is necessary for transmitting signals between devices.
2. Spectrum can cost a lot of money, depending on the frequency and the country. This is because governments often auction off spectrum to the highest bidder in order to maximize revenue.
3. Spectrum can be shared, as demonstrated by the FireChat app. This app creates a network of smart phones that can communicate with each other without an internet connection.

"So clearly we have a situation where the technology and infrastructure capacity both exist to reduce the cost of internet access, but such technologies are not well distributed. Why?

Primarily because mobile network operators have created an inflated cost base which makes it impossible to provide internet services to less affluent communities, but also because FabFi like solutions appear quite technical in nature. Good thing is that already there are many companies consciously innovating to make wireless communication equipment a lot more modular and user friendly.

"When I first shared with my friends and family that I will quit my career to make internet access affordable for all (c. March 2016), a good friend joked with me saying he always knew I was a “commie” and reminded me of this quote by Vladimir Lenin (1920).
Soon after reading this quote I became curious about how America (the anti-thesis of communism) solved its electricity access problem. For context, in the 1930s, 9/10 households did not have to access to electricity in America. By early 1970s, 98% of all rural farms had electrical service. The catalyst to this rapid infrastructure deployment was an incredible piece of legislation called the Rural Electrification Act of 1936.
The REA used federal funds to create electric cooperatives which used local labor to build out and maintain electricity infrastructure. In addition, REA hired advisors like Louisan Mamer (1910–2005) to show people how to use electricity.
Today about 900 electric cooperatives serve 56 percent of geographic America, despite accounting for only 11% of total electricity distribution revenues across the United States. Last week I got to meet individuals working for entities that were created as a result of the REA. Many of them are now focused on bringing high speed Internet to their communities because telephone and cable corporations are not incentivized to build infrastructure in sparsely populated areas.

"The more interesting fact he highlighted was that most telephone and cable corporations have affordable internet access plans (under $10/month on average) but that their call centers and customer service representatives are not incentivized to help improve “adoption” among low income individuals.

Lloyd Levine’s experiences as a California state law maker was in stark contrast to Joe Knapp’s experience from Sandy Oregon. Joe said that if SandyNet has an operational or service issue, he starts getting messages immediately from people he sees all the time at the grocery store, at school or at any community event. The case of SandyNet is quite inspiring especially considering the city of Sandy has a population of under 10,000!
Instead of giving dividends to stockholders, SandyNet focuses on keeping prices low for residents. This quote from Joe Knapp really stood out:

"3. “If you build it, they will come” is a fallacy, spelling out impact and describing applications is essential
Building open access infrastructure is just one part of the equation, spelling out precisely what infrastructure can do increases stakeholder alignment. Not every application can be envisioned from the get go but allocating time to imagine applications and quantify benefits increase likelihood of success. Katie Espeseth, VP of New Products at Electric Power Board (EPB) presented Chattanooga’s story.
She emphasized the need to spell out applications and collaborate with partners to put infrastructure to use. What I loved about Katie’s talk was her focus on impact. She set the stage by sharing a quote from Walter Cronkite (American journalist) who called Chattanooga the “dirtiest city in America”. Through photographs she showed how Chattanooga has left behind its dirty city legacy and has now become “Gig city” (i.e. city offering gigabit speed internet access).
My favorite example from Katie’s talk was about how high schools students in Chattanooga are able to experience biology and STEM like never before because their fiber network allows for high resolution imagery to get transmitted at very low latency levels. This video shows how students in Chattanooga are learning from a professor based in California while getting to operate a powerful microscope using a mouse thanks in part to a fiber network.

"OAVI enhances consumer choice by separating the underlying physical infrastructure from the network services. Each end user is empowered by being presented with his own infrastructure. As a result, every user has the ability to receive and/or deliver services across the infrastructure by utilizing a self provisioned network or by joining a network provided by any other user by joint agreement. Here is how the financial model works:
Within the municipal framework, utility infrastructure build costs are paid by the property owners desiring the utility service. This could be done via a standard municipal bond process which requires the support of the property owners who will receive the utility service.
The utility infrastructure maintenance and operational costs are paid by the property owners with access to the utility via a monthly utility service fee. It is important to note, that under the OAVI model, the utility service is virtualized infrastructure.
Services such as the Internet are delivered across the OAVI with an agreement between the provider and the end user. In this instance the end user is the service provider’s customer. When the end user desires a service other than his or her own, the OAVI model puts the end user in the middle of the network service provider and the infrastructure owner, thereby improving consumer choice and control.

"Challenges faced [15 mins]
In my life so far I have started multiple efforts, given up on too many and completed very few. I have often thought about what is it that makes me “show up” each day for the fulfilment of certain objectives but not others? Why do some objectives matter more than others? What is the best way to figure out what matters to me and why? I’ve written quite a bit about ideas of “Chul” and the benefits of understanding the reception conviction of your colleagues.
In 2014 for the first time I sat down to write what mattered to me and why? I found that introspection was very challenging, eventually after much struggle I concluded back then that “aligning incentives of driven and capable people with positive character traits (specifically the traits include: zest, grit, curiosity, optimism, self control, gratitude and social intelligence) matters to me because I want to live an incredible life but I don’t want my work to become a source of stress for my family, my colleagues, my customers or my partners.”
Living an incredible life meant dedicating all my energies to solving a really big problem that I care about and creating an a**-hole proof environment in the process.
2015 turned out to be an incredible year of self discovery. I came across the work of Ken Robinson who describes ways through which anyone can “find their element”. For Ken, our element is where talent meets passion. But is passion static? are talents static? I don’t think so. If talent and passion keeps evolving then so does our element. Considering our element keeps evolving, the same must be true for other human beings who collaborate with us to help achieve certain objectives.
For me, the answer of what mattered to me and why evolved as well. What I wrote in 2014 is still true, but it still is a means to an end. I have spent the past 2.5 years continuing to write down iterations of the same question and as of today I think levelling the playing field for all consciousness matters to me, but specifically what that’s now boiled down to is the following:
I want to dedicate my time and energy to join efforts through which I can significantly accelerate the following outcomes: a) make internet access free, b) make electricity access abundant / free and c) make financial capital abundant.
I believe the above 3 outcomes will happen irrespective of my efforts, I simply want to join conversations where the above 3 goals are a core focus. My hypothesis is that I will find beautiful minds across the globe if I join such conversations. After all, we are the “average of 5 people we spend most of our time with” and so the likelihood of me pushing up my average by talking to people who intend solving audacious goals is quite high
My journey has taught me that passions are not static. They evolve and that’s a problem to some extent for leaders and founders in particular because passions only get tested when the going gets tough. Often what separates success stories from failures is grit and persistence.
I believe that as entrepreneurs when we declare a commitment to a vision, we are making a statement about our passions and our convictions. It is the quality of our introspection that ensures authenticity of our stated purpose, and in my view determines the likelihood of our success.
As such, I turned to technology and research to improve the quality of my introspection",712,"Challenges faced [15 mins]

What gets measured gets done, what gets rewarded gets done repeatedly

So about 2 years I decided to measure my daily activity by installing a highly invasive application on my computer and smartphone, called Desktime
Measuring exactly how I was spending my time in 2014 helped me get a better sense of the delta between my actions and stated beliefs. So in 2015, I started pushing for change and initiated a process through which I could extract myself from my commitments in order to focus on what was really important. I found that measurement solidified my conviction and helped me follow through on actions which some of my friends thought were a bit “outrageous”.

"Do Your Commitments Match Your Convictions?
This paper needs to be read at a leisurely pace, it had one very potent exercise though:
“The first step in managing your commitments is to take a quick inventory of what matters to you. (For a helpful work sheet, see the exhibit “Taking Stock.”) You probably have at least a vague sense of what you value most, but it’s important to clarify those themes from time to time. This exercise lets you check whether you are putting your money (and your time and energy) where your mouth is. A systematic inventory of where your money, time, and energy are going often reveals surprising gaps.”
In addition to Desktime, I think your credit card statement or a tool like Expenify can help fill the money column most accurately. Energy is subjective, but a good rule of thumb: energy is maximum 90 minutes after waking up and then declines through out the day. So give more weightage to activities done 90 minutes after waking up. Clearly answering e mails shouldn’t be the first order of business!
Some gems from this paper:
“Our most binding commitments are frequently the result of day-to-day decisions too small to attract our attention.”
“The ruts that lock people into active inertia are the very commitments that led to their past successes but that have now hardened: Strategic frames become blinders, selected processes lapse into routines, relationships turn into shackles, resources become millstones, and once vibrant values ossify into dogmas.”
“Some of us experience “commitment creep.” We often commit ourselves without really thinking about what we are taking on. It is very easy to say yes to new commitments without reflecting on the long-term costs of honoring the implied promises or the potential conflicts that may develop with existing commitments.”
Importance of crises:
Crises force people to figure out what really matters.
Crises force people to make choices.
Crises can nullify outdated commitments.
Crises prompt people to clear their diaries.
Crises help to break the cycle of success.
“The Clutter Trap.
We fall into this trap when we are not systematically undoing old commitments as we take on new ones. As a result, so many promises — new and old — call out for our time and other resources that we may meet none of them or simply fall back on what we were doing before. Many of us have experienced this in our professional lives when we attend management meetings that add new items to our to-do list without removing existing ones. Taken as a whole, the agenda that emerges can be impossible. “

“The ruts that lock people into active inertia are the very commitments that led to their past successes but that have now hardened: Strategic frames become blinders, selected processes lapse into routines, relationships turn into shackles, resources become millstones, and once vibrant values ossify into dogmas.”
“Some of us experience “commitment creep.” We often commit ourselves without really thinking about what we are taking on. It is very easy to say yes to new commitments without reflecting on the long-term costs of honoring the implied promises or the potential conflicts that may develop with existing commitments.”
Importance of crises:
Crises force people to figure out what really matters.
Crises force people to make choices.
Crises can nullify outdated commitments.
Crises prompt people to clear their diaries.
Crises help to break the cycle of success.
“The Clutter Trap.
We fall into this trap when we are not systematically undoing old commitments as we take on new ones. As a result, so many promises — new and old — call out for our time and other resources that we may meet none of them or simply fall back on what we were doing before. Many of us have experienced this in our professional lives when we attend management meetings that add new items to our to-do list without removing existing ones. Taken as a whole, the agenda that emerges can be impossible. “

"Lessons Learned [20 mins]
To get a better sense of why introspection is often flawed, becoming more aware about how our mind is wired and how our brain makes decisions, it’s critical to understand the unconscious, something Leonard Mlodinow explains very well in this talk
Talk starts with an exercise to explain anchoring on the likely cost of a stay in a hotel(here’s a super cognitive bias cheat sheet)
Incredible examples are used to show case how the brain confuses itself in terms of identifying actual colour AND the brain’s inability to tell what the actual expression is when the face is upside down
Bottomline: the path to identifying what matters to you and why starts with awareness, it helps to understand our brain’s natural limitations and biases, and finally, without being completely honest to oneself, all introspective exercises are futility
Perhaps the biggest challenge remains the ability to find alignment between what we actually believe deep deep inside and the statements we make to the external world about our source of motivation
We can all figure out what really matters to us, all we really need to get there is a growth mindset, a term and a very powerful idea coined by Carol Dweck.
Vulnerability is the birthplace of creativity, innovation and change….The effect you have on others is the most valuable currency there is…Be weary of fear disguised as practicality…Choose love, not fear…and don’t be afraid to live an incredible life.
A lot of my learning related to my inner world has happened because of my wife, she has pretty much introduced me to most sources mentioned here. My wife’s latest discovery in her pursuit of her own self discovery is Angela Duckworth who has written an amazing book called Grit which pretty much brings together a whole lot of lessons I have sort of observed, but never had the ability to accurately articulate
Grit is doing what you love, but not just falling in love — staying in love
In Chapter 4 of Angela Duckworth’s book — Grit, she dives into something she calls the Grit Scale, and the big message delivered is that grit does not mean dogged intensity. Grit means finding consistency with investing 10,000 hours of practise while continuing to push towards one common higher order goal or life philosophy.
“…[D]ogged perseverance toward a top-level goal requires, paradoxically perhaps, some flexibility at lower levels in the goal hierarchy. It’s as if the highest-level goal gets written in ink, once you’ve done enough living and reflecting to know what that goal is, and the lower-level goals get written in pencil, so you can revise them and sometimes erase them altogether, and then figure out new ones to take their place.”",577,"Lessons Learned [20 mins]
