      "['Heart to heart with rookie board members', 'I got appointed as a director on a company’s board of directors for the first time in January 2012, I was 29 years old and had heard the term fiduciary duty for the very first time.\\nThe company in question was Inbox Business Technologies, Pakistan’s largest system integrator / technology services company by revenue. My appointment happened because Dawood Hercules Group (DH) owned a majority stake in Inbox and I was working with DH to launch a private equity firm called Cyan.\\nI remember being overwhelmed, not knowing where to turn for advice. The existing set of directors who I had interacted with didn’t have a uniform understanding of what it meant to be a good director. So I naturally turned to the web as I do for everything else. I came across two books I) Boards that Lead and II) CEO’s Boss. While the text was prescriptive and relevant I had a really hard time figuring out how to draw the line between “being strategic” and “being too operational”.\\nIn the years to come DH ended up appointing me on the boards of their most important companies including Engro Corporation and Engro Foods. I’m still not sure what I did right and what I did wrong, unfortunately a method to evaluate a director’s performance doesn’t exist or when it does is rarely implemented. However, I wish there existed a write-up back then for rookie or first time board members. This is that write up and contains some advice for first time directors.', '1. Read the board materials thoroughly and make notes\\nAs obvious as that sounds, at least in my experience I found that most directors at best skimmed through board materials as opposed to a diligent read. This was reflected in many questions they asked which were actually addressed in the pack. Now it is the Management’s job to prepare a precise pack but it’s unfair to put the entire responsibility on Management. Boards need to do their part and it starts with diligent reading, note taking and research.', '2. Invest time in really getting to know the CEO outside the board room\\nGroup mentality really kicks in during board meetings. The most influential or loudest voice often ends up trumping the group’s opinion and that leads to pretty wild swings on opinions related to some very important matters. Getting to know the CEO outside the board room helps in understanding what the board is talking about and what “really needs to be talked about”. The latter cannot be had in a formal boardroom like environment.', '3. Get to know the company’s customers and competitors\\nBoard meetings are often a one way communication where Management tells the board what’s going on. Very often, boards have no way of verifying whether assumptions proposed by Management are indeed inline with industry norms. Specifically pay attention to situations where company’s performance is not in line with the industry’s. I recall one company I was involved with, in a year where the entire industry made money, the company I was associated with lost money. Primarily because their cost base was so far off from industry norms.', '4. “Grilling” Management or “making a point” is not the point\\nVery often board meetings become an interrogation. There are some nice catch phrases directors will use such as “this is a board room and not a court room”. That said, the hardest part in being a rookie director is in trying really hard to convince others and yourself that you indeed add value. There’s a tendency to start grilling management unnecessarily to show that you add value. I surely did that. I was fortunate to have worked with an amazing CEO who helped me reform and realize that I couldn’t truly get effective if I wasn’t comfortable in my own skin.', '5. Stop trying to justify your presence to yourself\\nInsecurities kick in for a rookie director in a pretty big way. I found myself often thinking “wow I don’t belong here” or “how on earth did I get here”. That insecurity often leads to unnatural behavior which is usually guided by pleasing the popular opinion in the room. That’s exactly what one must not do. Instead I found that holding my own and sharing what my authentic self truly thought proved most valuable for stakeholders involved.\\n\\n6. Your duty is towards all stakeholders and not just shareholders\\nDirectors are appointed by shareholders and shareholders can fire directors. This often leads to a view, as it did with me, that allegiance is solely with shareholders. Such a view is shortsighted because unless all stakeholders, particularly Management, believe that everyone is playing on the same team, incentives can never be aligned. Therefore, optimizing asks for shareholders alone is often a recipe for disaster.', '7. Fire the CEO if you feel you must get too “operational”\\nThere’s a thin line between strategic decisions and operational decisions. Pricing a product may be an operational decision for many businesses but the thought process behind setting prices is indeed a strategic decision. Sitting on the sidelines and saying “well I’ve given my input” is not enough. If sh*t is about to hit the fan, then be prepared to roll sleeves and let the CEO know that you are a resource who is available to put up a fight if needed. Too many directors continue to sit on the sidelines because sometimes it’s just too convenient to focus solely on the “big picture”.\\n\\nThat said, the most important decision a board makes is hiring the CEO. If a CEO isn’t executing properly then don’t be afraid to fire the CEO.', 'That said, the most important decision a board makes is hiring the CEO. If a CEO isn’t executing properly then don’t be afraid to fire the CEO.\\n\\n8. Insist on director evaluations, if not formalized, ask for your own evaluation after every meeting\\nI love how Ray Dalio runs his meetings and how participants can rank each other’s input on a set of criterion. The same must be done for board meetings. If you are a rookie director, you are very fortunate and you must try to be the best director you can be. This can’t happen without feedback. It’s very hard to obtain tangible feedback and if such mechanism don’t exist, then seek feedback any way possible.', '9. Listen to understand and respond as opposed to gloss over and react.\\nThis goes back to insecurities and being worried that “you don’t belong”. Perhaps the worst attribute I’ve seen from directors is being verbose and not listening to understand but instead listening to react. Very often one runs into directors who are there to outshine others and make Management look bad in order to justify their own self worth. Such directors are awful for companies and the only purpose they serve is to satisfy their own fragile egos.\\n\\n10. There’s no right answer!\\nIn all my research to understand what makes a good director I ended up finding more questions than answers. I concluded that there’s no right answer. So long as you can be authentic, put in the effort, be prepared, get to know the stakeholders involved and provide input that’s genuinely in the company’s best interest you will end up doing a really great job.', 'Internet for all through infrastructure sharing\\nI delivered a TEDx talk in Budapest on May 5, while the video will take a few weeks, for now I wanted to share the written script and slides', 'Thousands of years ago many different tribes lived along the Yellow River in China. Many of them depended on the river for survival and prosperity, but all of them also suffered from periodical floods and draughts. No tribe could do anything because each of them controlled just one section of the river. Eventually all these tribes came together to form the Chinese nation which got an opportunity to control the entire length of the Yellow River. This coming together of tribes allowed the Chinese nation to bring thousands of people together to build canals and dams in order to regulate the river and prevent the worst floods or draughts.\\nToday, in the words of my favorite historian, “we are all living alongside the same cyber river, and no single nation can regulate this river by itself”. While I fully agree with Yuval Harari that overcoming present day challenges like climate change will require global coordination, I want to emphasize that the “we” he speaks of, only includes half of us, because even now half the human population cannot afford to access the internet. How can we achieve global coordination when 4 billion people cannot get online? I don’t think that’s possible.', 'I want to make internet access affordable for all because I think everyone should have the ability to ask a question and get a straight answer. You might think this is a nice, utopian but very expensive idea. I think otherwise. However, before going any further into why I think my goal is achievable without any major infrastructure spending program or technological breakthrough for that matter, I want us to be clear on what the internet is….\\nIn an age of instantaneous data transfers and magical handheld devices, it’s easy to forget that the internet is physical. The internet is made up of fiber optic cables, data centers, massive co location centers like 60 Hudson Street in New York, servers, routers, cell phone towers, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and virtually any physical medium that allows data to be stored and transferred from one point to another using the TCP/IP protocol.\\nMost of this internet infrastructure is owned or leased by private enterprises. When you run a google search on your smartphone, you are accessing this infrastructure, and at month end when you make a payment to your mobile network operator or internet service provider you are indirectly paying a toll or fee required to access this internet infrastructure. Such tolls and fees help mobile network operators and internet infrastructure owners cover their own costs and earn a financial return as well.\\nThe earliest known internet infrastructure was paid for by the US Government to make powerful computers more accessible to American researcher. Back then, accessing the internet was free for researchers, and expansion of internet infrastructure was centrally coordinated. Then in 1995 the US Govt owned infrastructure got privatized. In the same year the GSMA got established, which stands today as the largest global trade body of mobile network operators. The GSMA helped in creating standards which enabled the launch of SMS, Data and Fax services over wireless networks.', 'This intersection of internet infrastructure privatization and launch of wireless services worldwide created a gold rush of sorts because selling connectivity services without laying down cables or wires seemed like an attractive idea to investors in telecom companies. This also meant that many telecom companies offering virtually identical services would end up building excess and overlapping infrastructure to win over customers.\\nFor example, when mobile network operators started building out their respective wireless networks around the world, they made a conscious decision not to share cell towers because in the early days of network roll outs, coverage was viewed as a competitive advantage. A mobile network operator with presence in 60 cities was a more promising story than one with presence in 50 cities. Thus, mobile network operators often constructed cell towers right next to each other and this choice led to a scenario which was equivalent to a country building 4 to 5 overlapping highways that could not connect with one another.', 'Today, most mobile network operators no longer view coverage as a competitive advantage because a lot of the wireless infrastructure needed to provide coverage has already been built, in fact in many areas it has been over built. According to the International Telecommunication Union, 95% of the world population is touched in some way or form by a basic cellular network. Yet, we live in a situation where half the world population cannot get online largely because they cannot afford to pay the tolls and fees needed to access this information highway.\\nThe silver lining though is that many of these overbuilt highways I speak of are under utilized, meaning capacity clearly exists to accommodate a lot more traffic. However, accommodating more traffic will require these information highways to be shared and connected more effectively so that key choke points can be released.', 'To facilitate sharing and remove choke points, infrastructure sharing companies have emerged. An infrastructure sharing company typically buys and leases back a piece of infrastructure like a cell tower to enable sharing. Three mobile network operators sharing one cell tower results in lower operating and maintenance costs for all compared to a situation when one mobile network company uses one tower all by itself. Lowering of operating costs makes it more feasible to serve customers who want to get online but cannot afford to do so.\\nAt present 62% of total cell phone towers around the world are owned by infrastructure sharing companies, and while that number looks encouraging do bear in mind that cell towers are just one piece of internet infrastructure. To highlight this point further, even today most mobile network operators are not sharing the electronic equipment which gets installed on cell towers.', 'While electronic equipment on cell towers in not being shared at present, it is continuing to become a lot more energy efficient and smaller in size as well. Just like mainframe computers morphed into laptops and tablets, the same trend is playing out in the world of wireless communication equipment. So while the cell towers or the power capacity attached to those towers is staying the same size, the equipment which gets installed on them is becoming a lot smaller and energy efficient.\\nEven using the older larger telecom equipment as a proxy, I can tell you that most cell towers have the capacity to accommodate twice as much electronic equipment as they do today.\\nThe larger implication is that by renting out a little bit of space on cell towers which is not getting used to begin with, combined with energy efficient small size electronic equipment, while utilizing the immense computing capacity available in billions of smart phones, a company or cooperative could theoretically create a connectivity service that is a lot cheaper than any alternative simply because this new service I speak of would not have to build infrastructure to get coverage in the first place and will not be held back by highly bureaucratic processes either.\\nA good example is FabFi, which is a wireless internet network made by MIT’s FabLab in Jalalabad Afghanistan using trash in 2010. This network remains one of the cheapest wireless networks ever built. If instead of trash, what if FabFi equipment could be installed on small little rented spaces on towers across the globe? Could such an idea help make internet access affordable and ubiquitous?', 'To some extent yes, but a global FabFi type wireless network will require access to something called spectrum. Spectrum is basically airwaves which are used by mobile network operators, TV stations and radio stations to transmit signals. Some spectrum like the one used by Wi-Fi routers or Bluetooth devices is free to use, most of it though, is allocated through auctions by governments. Governments have been known to charge as much as possible for licensing spectrum, and this desire to maximize spectrum price is a major factor other than the overlapping infrastructure capacity which keeps cost of connectivity high. The silver lining here is that similar to all other pieces of internet infrastructure, spectrum can also be shared.\\nA great example of a product using amateur spectrum on a shared basis is FireChat, this product is a messenger that works without an internet connection because FireChat creates a network of smart phones. If a quarter of people in this hall had FireChat installed and were equally spread out, I could send a message all the way to the back of the hall through FireChat without switching on my data service.', 'So clearly we have a situation where the technology and infrastructure capacity both exist to reduce the cost of internet access, but such technologies are not well distributed. Why?\\n\\nPrimarily because mobile network operators have created an inflated cost base which makes it impossible to provide internet services to less affluent communities, but also because FabFi like solutions appear quite technical in nature. Good thing is that already there are many companies consciously innovating to make wireless communication equipment a lot more modular and user friendly. Examples of such products include the Supabrick by BRCK and MeshPotato by Village Telco Project.', 'A combination of shared infrastructure, user friendly wireless equipment and amateur spectrum will not prove sufficient to live stream Game of Thrones in high definition, but such a service will make it feasible to run a basic google search and steam an audio podcast as well.\\nI envision a future when a Kalasha girl living in Northwest Pakistan can afford to own a device which she can speak into in her own language and get a straight answer. This is not feasible today considering 56% of web content is English, she can barely afford a smartphone and speech to text technologies have not quite matured. However, I stand convinced that a day will arrive when she will be able to speak into a device, ask a question about how best to treat her daughter’s fever, and get a straight answer. When that day comes, I want to ensure that this girl right here can afford to access the internet.', 'At present I don’t have a business model in my mind that will help me sustain this quest for answers, but I have roughly 3 years worth of savings to push this conversation as far as possible. I believe the best way to predict the future is to create it and that is why I decided to quit my career from the world of private equity investments and corporate board rooms.\\nI learned recently that there are 43 quintillion possible combinations of a Rubik’s cube, but in any position there are 20 moves that solves the cube. However, you have to get the first few moves right. I am convinced that making internet access affordable for all is an optimal first move. If we get this first move right I believe overcoming other global grand challenges we face today will become a lot easier as well, and we will finally become able to regulate this cyber river which we’ve all grown to depend on for our survival and prosperity.', 'Why do I crave relevance?\\nI crave for relevance because feeling relevant truly makes me feel alive.\\n\\nDays when I feel irrelevant are terrible, and often bring out the worst in me because all my insecurities get triggered when I’m feeling irrelevant.

March 2016), a good friend joked with me saying he always knew I was a “commie” and reminded me of this quote by Vladimir Lenin (1920).\\nSoon after reading this quote I became curious about how America (the anti-thesis of communism) solved its electricity access problem. For context, in the 1930s, 9/10 households did not have to access to electricity in America. By early 1970s, 98% of all rural farms had electrical service. The catalyst to this rapid infrastructure deployment was an incredible piece of legislation called the Rural Electrification Act of 1936.\\nThe REA used federal funds to create electric cooperatives which used local labor to build out and maintain electricity infrastructure. In addition, REA hired advisors like Louisan Mamer (1910–2005) to show people how to use electricity.\\nToday about 900 electric cooperatives serve 56 percent of geographic America, despite accounting for only 11% of total electricity distribution revenues across the United States. Last week I got to meet individuals working for entities that were created as a result of the REA. Many of them are now focused on bringing high speed Internet to their communities because telephone and cable corporations are not incentivized to build infrastructure in sparsely populated areas.\\nWhile listening to presenters who have mobilized local governments and communities to build broadband infrastructure, I observed the following themes:', '1. Broadband is not a partisan issue\\nTune into CNN or Fox News and it seems that Republicans and Democrats are ready to annihilate each other. There is no doubt that America is more polarized today than years past but when it comes to bringing high quality internet access to ignored areas, political ideologies become secondary.\\nSeveral presenters shared this view but the session which provided richer insights was the one hosted by Deborah and James Fallows. The Fallows shared findings from their travels across smaller towns one normally doesn’t hear about (see map below). The Fallows emphasized that the key ingredient which ensures collaboration across the aisle is mutual respect.\\nDeborah shared that she often found herself near a library in the evening as quite often only libraries had internet access and librarians were kind enough to leave WiFi on. The more interesting comment was about the homeless: Deborah shared that many homeless people said that it’s only at libraries where they get respect and that’s why they often congregate there.\\nAvenues to explore based on this theme: identify conferences where city and local government officials from different countries can get an opportunity to learn from one another. Identify libraries on maps where fiber deployments are being planned.', '2. Local government involvement ensures community buy-in and enhances Internet adoption rates\\nLloyd Levine shared findings of his research paper in which he draws an important distinction between broadband “access” and “adoption”. He goes on to define what “meaningful internet access” is and suggests that smartphones by themselves are not sufficient to provide meaningful internet access.', 'The more interesting fact he highlighted was that most telephone and cable corporations have affordable internet access plans (under $10/month on average) but that their call centers and customer service representatives are not incentivized to help improve “adoption” among low income individuals.\\nAs a result of misaligned incentives, 30% of Californians lack meaningful internet access.\\nLloyd Levine’s experiences as a California state law maker was in stark contrast to Joe Knapp’s experience from Sandy Oregon. Joe said that if SandyNet has an operational or service issue, he starts getting messages immediately from people he sees all the time at the grocery store, at school or at any community event. The case of SandyNet is quite inspiring especially considering the city of Sandy has a population of under 10,000!\\nInstead of giving dividends to stockholders, SandyNet focuses on keeping prices low for residents. This quote from Joe Knapp really stood out:\\n“We’re able to operate very lean because my service footprint is Sandy and my staff all live and work in Sandy, so we’re able to operate in a different manner than a lot of those companies (AT&T, Verizon, Comcast etc) are”\\nAvenues to explore based on this theme: The biggest deployment in Middle America that I know of has 175,000 people (Chattanooga, TN) and the smallest with under 10,000 people. Beyond a certain size, any effort loses the “local” touch, but what is that size?', '3. “If you build it, they will come” is a fallacy, spelling out impact and describing applications is essential\\nBuilding open access infrastructure is just one part of the equation, spelling out precisely what infrastructure can do increases stakeholder alignment. Not every application can be envisioned from the get go but allocating time to imagine applications and quantify benefits increase likelihood of success. Katie Espeseth, VP of New Products at Electric Power Board (EPB) presented Chattanooga’s story.\\nShe emphasized the need to spell out applications and collaborate with partners to put infrastructure to use. What I loved about Katie’s talk was her focus on impact. She set the stage by sharing a quote from Walter Cronkite (American journalist) who called Chattanooga the “dirtiest city in America”. Through photographs she showed how Chattanooga has left behind its dirty city legacy and has now become “Gig city” (i.e. city offering gigabit speed internet access).\\nMy favorite example from Katie’s talk was about how high schools students in Chattanooga are able to experience biology and STEM like never before because their fiber network allows for high resolution imagery to get transmitted at very low latency levels. This video shows how students in Chattanooga are learning from a professor based in California while getting to operate a powerful microscope using a mouse thanks in part to a fiber network.\\nAvenues to explore based on this theme: quantify economic and financial impact resulting from large scale fiber deployments on utility infrastructure. Perhaps figure out a way to make such videos as well to get the point across.', '4. Fiber is (most likely) future proof but conduit has often made all the difference\\nMy favorite slide from the conference was presented by Joanne Hovis, CEO of CTC Technologies which showed capabilities of different communication technologies and thanks to an awesome search engine like Google I’ve been able to locate that slide without bothering Joanne!\\nI am personally on the fiber side of the story as well, my current view says that deploying fiber on electric utility infrastructure is our best bet to make Internet for all financially feasible.\\nFiber’s virtually unlimited capacity is driven by its physics which I don’t understand all that well. However, just noticing the data throughput capability of optical modules over time shows an exponential curve. Considering data consumption grows exponentially as well, fiber as a transport medium seems to be an obvious choice.', 'Data throughput capacity of optical modules\\nThat said, the most important and relevant comment I took away was from Nathan Rosenberg from the Broadband Group. Nathan said that fiber is “probably” future proof but that presence of conduit is often what has made the difference in feasible projects and unfeasible projects. I loved this quote from him\\nThere is such a thing as bad broadband project!\\nConduit is a tube or pipe through which multiple other pipes can pass. Cities which had conduit found that deploying fiber was quite cost effective.\\nAvenues to explore based on this theme: identify areas where conduit is deployed but fiber is not, to assess opportunities for low cost fiber deployments.', '5. Customer service is a critical success factor, but a monopoly owning the customer relationship is not the “only” option\\nEveryone present agreed that customer service is critical, however, not all local broadband initiatives are consumer facing ie last mile served by the municipality or cooperative. Some have chosen (eg Ammon Idaho) to take a wholesale approach where infrastructure acts as an enabler. In contrast, EPB feels very strongly about owning the customer relationship themselves.\\nI can see that for towns like Sandy, a consumer facing monopoly makes sense. But for bigger towns it’s possible that complacency sets in eventually and perhaps a wholesale approach would work better.\\nAmmon’s model is described as Open Access Virtual Infrastructure (OAVI) which makes the actual infrastructure available to the end user through the use of virtualization, rather than the infrastructure’s services.', 'OAVI enhances consumer choice by separating the underlying physical infrastructure from the network services. Each end user is empowered by being presented with his own infrastructure. As a result, every user has the ability to receive and/or deliver services across the infrastructure by utilizing a self provisioned network or by joining a network provided by any other user by joint agreement. Here is how the financial model works:\\nWithin the municipal framework, utility infrastructure build costs are paid by the property owners desiring the utility service. This could be done via a standard municipal bond process which requires the support of the property owners who will receive the utility service.\\nThe utility infrastructure maintenance and operational costs are paid by the property owners with access to the utility via a monthly utility service fee. It is important to note, that under the OAVI model, the utility service is virtualized infrastructure.\\nServices such as the Internet are delivered across the OAVI with an agreement between the provider and the end user. In this instance the end user is the service provider’s customer. When the end user desires a service other than his or her own, the OAVI model puts the end user in the middle of the network service provider and the infrastructure owner, thereby improving consumer choice and control.\\nWatching the video below on Ammon’s model is well worth your time, it explains Ammon’s model and applications as well.', 'Avenues to explore based on this theme: obtain data to assess adoption rate variation depending on business model adopted.\\nAcknowledgments\\nI am very grateful to Jim Baller of Baller, Stokes & Lide for inviting me to the BBC Magazine conference and for being a champion of affordable broadband for majority of his career.', '“What matters to you and why?” – my journey so far with this loaded question', 'Challenges faced [15 mins]\\nIn my life so far I have started multiple efforts, given up on too many and completed very few. I have often thought about what is it that makes me “show up” each day for the fulfilment of certain objectives but not others? Why do some objectives matter more than others? What is the best way to figure out what matters to me and why? I’ve written quite a bit about ideas of “Chul” and the benefits of understanding the reception conviction of your colleagues.\\nIn 2014 for the first time I sat down to write what mattered to me and why? I found that introspection was very challenging, eventually after much struggle I concluded back then that “aligning incentives of driven and capable people with positive character traits (specifically the traits include: zest, grit, curiosity, optimism, self control, gratitude and social intelligence) matters to me because I want to live an incredible life but I don’t want my work to become a source of stress for my family, my colleagues, my customers or my partners.”\\nLiving an incredible life meant dedicating all my energies to solving a really big problem that I care about and creating an a**-hole proof environment in the process.\\n2015 turned out to be an incredible year of self discovery. I came across the work of Ken Robinson who describes ways through which anyone can “find their element”. For Ken, our element is where talent meets passion. But is passion static? are talents static? I don’t think so. If talent and passion keeps evolving then so does our element. Considering our element keeps evolving, the same must be true for other human beings who collaborate with us to help achieve certain objectives.\\nFor me, the answer of what mattered to me and why evolved as well. What I wrote in 2014 is still true, but it still is a means to an end. I have spent the past 2.5 years continuing to write down iterations of the same question and as of today I think levelling the playing field for all consciousness matters to me, but specifically what that’s now boiled down to is the following:\\nI want to dedicate my time and energy to join efforts through which I can significantly accelerate the following outcomes: a) make internet access free, b) make electricity access abundant / free and c) make financial capital abundant.\\nI believe the above 3 outcomes will happen irrespective of my efforts, I simply want to join conversations where the above 3 goals are a core focus. My hypothesis is that I will find beautiful minds across the globe if I join such conversations. After all, we are the “average of 5 people we spend most of our time with” and so the likelihood of me pushing up my average by talking to people who intend solving audacious goals is quite high\\nMy journey has taught me that passions are not static. They evolve and that’s a problem to some extent for leaders and founders in particular because passions only get tested when the going gets tough. Often what separates success stories from failures is grit and persistence.\\nI believe that as entrepreneurs when we declare a commitment to a vision, we are making a statement about our passions and our convictions. It is the quality of our introspection that ensures authenticity of our stated purpose, and in my view determines the likelihood of our success.\\nAs such, I turned to technology and research to improve the quality of my introspection', 'Pathways explored [25 mins]\\nWhat gets measured gets done, what gets rewarded gets done repeatedly\\nWhen I genuinely started introspecting, I found the process of introspection to be quite flawed and prevailing academic literature seemed to suggest the same. So about 2 years I decided to measure my daily activity by installing a highly invasive application on my computer and smartphone, called Desktime\\nMeasuring exactly how I was spending my time in 2014 helped me get a better sense of the delta between my actions and stated beliefs. So in 2015, I started pushing for change and initiated a process through which I could extract myself from my commitments in order to focus on what was really important. I found that measurement solidified my conviction and helped me follow through on actions which some of my friends thought were a bit “outrageous”. They felt this simply because I had a rather “stable / well paying job”.\\nAs preparation for this talk, I decided to do a literature review and found an excellent paper that was published on HBR which captures my thought process in a much better way.', 'Do Your Commitments Match Your Convictions?\\nThis paper needs to be read at a leisurely pace, it had one very potent exercise though:\\n“The first step in managing your commitments is to take a quick inventory of what matters to you. (For a helpful work sheet, see the exhibit “Taking Stock.”) You probably have at least a vague sense of what you value most, but it’s important to clarify those themes from time to time. This exercise lets you check whether you are putting your money (and your time and energy) where your mouth is. A systematic inventory of where your money, time, and energy are going often reveals surprising gaps.”\\nIn addition to Desktime, I think your credit card statement or a tool like Expenify can help fill the money column most accurately. Energy is subjective, but a good rule of thumb: energy is maximum 90 minutes after waking up and then declines through out the day. So give more weightage to activities done 90 minutes after waking up. Clearly answering e mails shouldn’t be the first order of business!\\nSome gems from this paper:\\n“Our most binding commitments are frequently the result of day-to-day decisions too small to attract our attention.”\\n“The ruts that lock people into active inertia are the very commitments that led to their past successes but that have now hardened: Strategic frames become blinders, selected processes lapse into routines, relationships turn into shackles, resources become millstones, and once vibrant values ossify into dogmas.”\\n“Some of us experience “commitment creep.” We often commit ourselves without really thinking about what we are taking on. It is very easy to say yes to new commitments without reflecting on the long-term costs of honoring the implied promises or the potential conflicts that may develop with existing commitments.”\\nImportance of crises:\\nCrises force people to figure out what really matters.\\nCrises force people to make choices.\\nCrises can nullify outdated commitments.\\nCrises prompt people to clear their diaries.\\nCrises help to break the cycle of success.\\n“The Clutter Trap.\\nWe fall into this trap when we are not systematically undoing old commitments as we take on new ones. As a result, so many promises — new and old — call out for our time and other resources that we may meet none of them or simply fall back on what we were doing before. Many of us have experienced this in our professional lives when we attend management meetings that add new items to our to-do list without removing existing ones.

      "I got appointed as a director on a company’s board of directors for the first time in January 2012, I was 29 years old and had heard the term fiduciary duty for the very first time.\n",
      "The company in question was Inbox Business Technologies, Pakistan’s largest system integrator / technology services company by revenue. My appointment happened because Dawood Hercules Group (DH) owned a majority stake in Inbox and I was working with DH to launch a private equity firm called Cyan.\n",
      "I remember being overwhelmed, not knowing where to turn for advice. The existing set of directors who I had interacted with didn’t have a uniform understanding of what it meant to be a good director. So I naturally turned to the web as I do for everything else. I came across two books I) Boards that Lead and II) CEO’s Boss. While the text was prescriptive and relevant I had a really hard time figuring out how to draw the line between “being strategic” and “being too operational”.\n",
      "In the years to come DH ended up appointing me on the boards of their most important companies including Engro Corporation and Engro Foods. I’m still not sure what I did right and what I did wrong, unfortunately a method to evaluate a director’s performance doesn’t exist or when it does is rarely implemented. However, I wish there existed a write-up back then for rookie or first time board members. This is that write up and contains some advice for first time directors.  What is a fiduciary duty?\n",

      "4. What advice would the author give to first time directors?\n",
      "2. Invest time in really getting to know the CEO outside the board room\n",
      "Group mentality really kicks in during board meetings. The most influential or loudest voice often ends up trumping the group’s opinion and that leads to pretty wild swings on opinions related to some very important matters. Getting to know the CEO outside the board room helps in understanding what the board is talking about and what “really needs to be talked about”. The latter cannot be had in a formal boardroom like environment.  What is the group mentality like during board meetings?\n",

      "3. Get to know the company’s customers and competitors\n",
      "Board meetings are often a one way communication where Management tells the board what’s going on. Very often, boards have no way of verifying whether assumptions proposed by Management are indeed inline with industry norms. Specifically pay attention to situations where company’s performance is not in line with the industry’s. I recall one company I was involved with, in a year where the entire industry made money, the company I was associated with lost money. Primarily because their cost base was so far off from industry norms.  What is the main purpose of board meetings?\n",

      "5. Stop trying to justify your presence to yourself\n",
      "Insecurities kick in for a rookie director in a pretty big way. I found myself often thinking “wow I don’t belong here” or “how on earth did I get here”. That insecurity often leads to unnatural behavior which is usually guided by pleasing the popular opinion in the room. That’s exactly what one must not do. Instead I found that holding my own and sharing what my authentic self truly thought proved most valuable for stakeholders involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Your duty is towards all stakeholders and not just shareholders\n",
      "Directors are appointed by shareholders and shareholders can fire directors. This often leads to a view, as it did with me, that allegiance is solely with shareholders. Such a view is shortsighted because unless all stakeholders, particularly Management, believe that everyone is playing on the same team, incentives can never be aligned. Therefore, optimizing asks for shareholders alone is often a recipe for disaster.  What are the consequences of directors not pleasing the popular opinion in the room?\n",
      "2. How can a rookie director hold their own and share their authentic self in order to be most valuable to stakeholders involved?\n",
      "3. Why is it important for directors to have an allegiance to all stakeholders and not just shareholders?\n",
      "7. Fire the CEO if you feel you must get too “operational”\n",
      "There’s a thin line between strategic decisions and operational decisions. Pricing a product may be an operational decision for many businesses but the thought process behind setting prices is indeed a strategic decision. Sitting on the sidelines and saying “well I’ve given my input” is not enough. If sh*t is about to hit the fan, then be prepared to roll sleeves and let the CEO know that you are a resource who is available to put up a fight if needed. Too many directors continue to sit on the sidelines because sometimes it’s just too convenient to focus solely on the “big picture”.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the most important decision a board makes is hiring the CEO. If a CEO isn’t executing properly then don’t be afraid to fire the CEO.  What is the difference between a strategic decision and an operational decision?\n",

      "I love how Ray Dalio runs his meetings and how participants can rank each other’s input on a set of criterion. The same must be done for board meetings. If you are a rookie director, you are very fortunate and you must try to be the best director you can be. This can’t happen without feedback. It’s very hard to obtain tangible feedback and if such mechanism don’t exist, then seek feedback any way possible.  What is the most important decision a board makes?\n",

      "4. How can feedback be obtained effectively?\n",
      "9. Listen to understand and respond as opposed to gloss over and react.\n",
      "This goes back to insecurities and being worried that “you don’t belong”. Perhaps the worst attribute I’ve seen from directors is being verbose and not listening to understand but instead listening to react. Very often one runs into directors who are there to outshine others and make Management look bad in order to justify their own self worth. Such directors are awful for companies and the only purpose they serve is to satisfy their own fragile egos.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. There’s no right answer!\n",
      "In all my research to understand what makes a good director I ended up finding more questions than answers. I concluded that there’s no right answer. So long as you can be authentic, put in the effort, be prepared, get to know the stakeholders involved and provide input that’s genuinely in the company’s best interest you will end up doing a really great job.  What makes a good director?\n",

      "Thousands of years ago many different tribes lived along the Yellow River in China. Many of them depended on the river for survival and prosperity, but all of them also suffered from periodical floods and draughts. No tribe could do anything because each of them controlled just one section of the river. Eventually all these tribes came together to form the Chinese nation which got an opportunity to control the entire length of the Yellow River. This coming together of tribes allowed the Chinese nation to bring thousands of people together to build canals and dams in order to regulate the river and prevent the worst floods or draughts.\n",
      "Today, in the words of my favorite historian, “we are all living alongside the same cyber river, and no single nation can regulate this river by itself”. While I fully agree with Yuval Harari that overcoming present day challenges like climate change will require global coordination, I want to emphasize that the “we” he speaks of, only includes half of us, because even now half the human population cannot afford to access the internet. How can we achieve global coordination when 4 billion people cannot get online? I don’t think that’s possible.  What is the main point of the text?\n",
      "2. What is the difference between the Chinese nation and \"we\" today?\n",
      "3. How can global coordination be achieved when 4 billion people cannot get online?\n",
      "I want to make internet access affordable for all because I think everyone should have the ability to ask a question and get a straight answer. You might think this is a nice, utopian but very expensive idea. I think otherwise. However, before going any further into why I think my goal is achievable without any major infrastructure spending program or technological breakthrough for that matter, I want us to be clear on what the internet is….\n",
      "In an age of instantaneous data transfers and magical handheld devices, it’s easy to forget that the internet is physical. The internet is made up of fiber optic cables, data centers, massive co location centers like 60 Hudson Street in New York, servers, routers, cell phone towers, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and virtually any physical medium that allows data to be stored and transferred from one point to another using the TCP/IP protocol.\n",
      "Most of this internet infrastructure is owned or leased by private enterprises. When you run a google search on your smartphone, you are accessing this infrastructure, and at month end when you make a payment to your mobile network operator or internet service provider you are indirectly paying a toll or fee required to access this internet infrastructure. Such tolls and fees help mobile network operators and internet infrastructure owners cover their own costs and earn a financial return as well.\n",
      "The earliest known internet infrastructure was paid for by the US Government to make powerful computers more accessible to American researcher. Back then, accessing the internet was free for researchers, and expansion of internet infrastructure was centrally coordinated. Then in 1995 the US Govt owned infrastructure got privatized. In the same year the GSMA got established, which stands today as the largest global trade body of mobile network operators. The GSMA helped in creating standards which enabled the launch of SMS, Data and Fax services over wireless networks.  What is the internet?\n",
      "2. What is the GSMA?\n",
      "3. What was the role of the GSMA in the development of the internet?\n",
      "This intersection of internet infrastructure privatization and launch of wireless services worldwide created a gold rush of sorts because selling connectivity services without laying down cables or wires seemed like an attractive idea to investors in telecom companies. This also meant that many telecom companies offering virtually identical services would end up building excess and overlapping infrastructure to win over customers.\n",
      "For example, when mobile network operators started building out their respective wireless networks around the world, they made a conscious decision not to share cell towers because in the early days of network roll outs, coverage was viewed as a competitive advantage. A mobile network operator with presence in 60 cities was a more promising story than one with presence in 50 cities. Thus, mobile network operators often constructed cell towers right next to each other and this choice led to a scenario which was equivalent to a country building 4 to 5 overlapping highways that could not connect with one another.  What is the author's main argument?\n",
      "2. What are some examples of how the author's argument is illustrated in the text?\n",
      "3. What implications does the author's argument have for the future?\n",
      "Today, most mobile network operators no longer view coverage as a competitive advantage because a lot of the wireless infrastructure needed to provide coverage has already been built, in fact in many areas it has been over built. According to the International Telecommunication Union, 95% of the world population is touched in some way or form by a basic cellular network. Yet, we live in a situation where half the world population cannot get online largely because they cannot afford to pay the tolls and fees needed to access this information highway.\n",
      "The silver lining though is that many of these overbuilt highways I speak of are under utilized, meaning capacity clearly exists to accommodate a lot more traffic. However, accommodating more traffic will require these information highways to be shared and connected more effectively so that key choke points can be released.  What is the main point of the text?\n",
      "2. What is the main problem with the current state of mobile networks?\n",
      "3. What is the solution to the main problem?\n",
      "To facilitate sharing and remove choke points, infrastructure sharing companies have emerged. An infrastructure sharing company typically buys and leases back a piece of infrastructure like a cell tower to enable sharing. Three mobile network operators sharing one cell tower results in lower operating and maintenance costs for all compared to a situation when one mobile network company uses one tower all by itself. Lowering of operating costs makes it more feasible to serve customers who want to get online but cannot afford to do so.\n",
      "At present 62% of total cell phone towers around the world are owned by infrastructure sharing companies, and while that number looks encouraging do bear in mind that cell towers are just one piece of internet infrastructure. To highlight this point further, even today most mobile network operators are not sharing the electronic equipment which gets installed on cell towers.  What is an infrastructure sharing company?\n",
      "2. What does an infrastructure sharing company typically do?\n",
      "3. What are the benefits of infrastructure sharing?\n",
      "4. What is the current percentage of cell phone towers that are owned by infrastructure sharing companies?\n",
      "5. What is the main obstacle to infrastructure sharing?\n",
      "While electronic equipment on cell towers in not being shared at present, it is continuing to become a lot more energy efficient and smaller in size as well. Just like mainframe computers morphed into laptops and tablets, the same trend is playing out in the world of wireless communication equipment. So while the cell towers or the power capacity attached to those towers is staying the same size, the equipment which gets installed on them is becoming a lot smaller and energy efficient.\n",
      "Even using the older larger telecom equipment as a proxy, I can tell you that most cell towers have the capacity to accommodate twice as much electronic equipment as they do today.\n",
      "The larger implication is that by renting out a little bit of space on cell towers which is not getting used to begin with, combined with energy efficient small size electronic equipment, while utilizing the immense computing capacity available in billions of smart phones, a company or cooperative could theoretically create a connectivity service that is a lot cheaper than any alternative simply because this new service I speak of would not have to build infrastructure to get coverage in the first place and will not be held back by highly bureaucratic processes either.\n",
      "A good example is FabFi, which is a wireless internet network made by MIT’s FabLab in Jalalabad Afghanistan using trash in 2010. This network remains one of the cheapest wireless networks ever built. If instead of trash, what if FabFi equipment could be installed on small little rented spaces on towers across the globe? Could such an idea help make internet access affordable and ubiquitous?  What is the trend in wireless communication equipment?\n",
      "2. How is this trend impacting cell towers?\n",
      "3. What is the potential for a new service that uses small, energy efficient equipment?\n",
      "4. How does FabFi provide wireless internet access?\n",
      "5. What are the implications of this technology?\n",
      "To some extent yes, but a global FabFi type wireless network will require access to something called spectrum. Spectrum is basically airwaves which are used by mobile network operators, TV stations and radio stations to transmit signals. Some spectrum like the one used by Wi-Fi routers or Bluetooth devices is free to use, most of it though, is allocated through auctions by governments. Governments have been known to charge as much as possible for licensing spectrum, and this desire to maximize spectrum price is a major factor other than the overlapping infrastructure capacity which keeps cost of connectivity high. The silver lining here is that similar to all other pieces of internet infrastructure, spectrum can also be shared.\n",
      "A great example of a product using amateur spectrum on a shared basis is FireChat, this product is a messenger that works without an internet connection because FireChat creates a network of smart phones. If a quarter of people in this hall had FireChat installed and were equally spread out, I could send a message all the way to the back of the hall through FireChat without switching on my data service.  What is spectrum and why is it important for a global FabFi type wireless network?\n",
      "2. How much does spectrum cost and why?\n",
      "3. Can spectrum be shared and if so, how?\n",
      "4. What is an example of a product that uses amateur spectrum on a shared basis?\n",
      "So clearly we have a situation where the technology and infrastructure capacity both exist to reduce the cost of internet access, but such technologies are not well distributed. Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "Primarily because mobile network operators have created an inflated cost base which makes it impossible to provide internet services to less affluent communities, but also because FabFi like solutions appear quite technical in nature. Good thing is that already there are many companies consciously innovating to make wireless communication equipment a lot more modular and user friendly. Examples of such products include the Supabrick by BRCK and MeshPotato by Village Telco Project.  What is the inflated cost base that mobile network operators have created?\n",

      "Local communities in rural America are showing what needs to happen to make “Internet for all” financially feasible on a global scale, this post elaborates 5 themes I observed at the Broadband Communities Conference held in Ontario CA (Oct 2018)  What are the five themes that were observed at the Broadband Communities Conference?\n",
      "2. What are the benefits of broadband initiatives across rural America?\n",
      "3. What makes \"Internet for all\" financially feasible on a global scale?\n",
      "When I first shared with my friends and family that I will quit my career to make internet access affordable for all (c. March 2016), a good friend joked with me saying he always knew I was a “commie” and reminded me of this quote by Vladimir Lenin (1920).\n",
      "Soon after reading this quote I became curious about how America (the anti-thesis of communism) solved its electricity access problem. For context, in the 1930s, 9/10 households did not have to access to electricity in America. By early 1970s, 98% of all rural farms had electrical service. The catalyst to this rapid infrastructure deployment was an incredible piece of legislation called the Rural Electrification Act of 1936.\n",
      "The REA used federal funds to create electric cooperatives which used local labor to build out and maintain electricity infrastructure. In addition, REA hired advisors like Louisan Mamer (1910–2005) to show people how to use electricity.\n",
      "Today about 900 electric cooperatives serve 56 percent of geographic America, despite accounting for only 11% of total electricity distribution revenues across the United States. Last week I got to meet individuals working for entities that were created as a result of the REA. Many of them are now focused on bringing high speed Internet to their communities because telephone and cable corporations are not incentivized to build infrastructure in sparsely populated areas.\n",
      "While listening to presenters who have mobilized local governments and communities to build broadband infrastructure, I observed the following themes:  What did the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 do?\n",
      "2. How did it catalyze the rapid deployment of electricity infrastructure?\n",
      "3. What are the themes that emerged from the presenters at the conference?\n",
      "1. Broadband is not a partisan issue\n",
      "Tune into CNN or Fox News and it seems that Republicans and Democrats are ready to annihilate each other. There is no doubt that America is more polarized today than years past but when it comes to bringing high quality internet access to ignored areas, political ideologies become secondary.\n",
      "Several presenters shared this view but the session which provided richer insights was the one hosted by Deborah and James Fallows. The Fallows shared findings from their travels across smaller towns one normally doesn’t hear about (see map below). The Fallows emphasized that the key ingredient which ensures collaboration across the aisle is mutual respect.\n",
      "Deborah shared that she often found herself near a library in the evening as quite often only libraries had internet access and librarians were kind enough to leave WiFi on. The more interesting comment was about the homeless: Deborah shared that many homeless people said that it’s only at libraries where they get respect and that’s why they often congregate there.\n",
      "Avenues to explore based on this theme: identify conferences where city and local government officials from different countries can get an opportunity to learn from one another. Identify libraries on maps where fiber deployments are being planned.  What did the Fallows find during their travels across America?\n",

      "2. Local government involvement ensures community buy-in and enhances Internet adoption rates\n",
      "Lloyd Levine shared findings of his research paper in which he draws an important distinction between broadband “access” and “adoption”. He goes on to define what “meaningful internet access” is and suggests that smartphones by themselves are not sufficient to provide meaningful internet access.  What is Lloyd Levine's research paper about?\n",
      "2. What is the distinction between broadband \"access\" and \"adoption\"?\n",
      "3. What does Lloyd Levine suggest about smartphones?\n",
      "4. What is the definition of \"meaningful internet access\"?\n",
      "The more interesting fact he highlighted was that most telephone and cable corporations have affordable internet access plans (under $10/month on average) but that their call centers and customer service representatives are not incentivized to help improve “adoption” among low income individuals.\n",
      "As a result of misaligned incentives, 30% of Californians lack meaningful internet access.\n",
      "Lloyd Levine’s experiences as a California state law maker was in stark contrast to Joe Knapp’s experience from Sandy Oregon. Joe said that if SandyNet has an operational or service issue, he starts getting messages immediately from people he sees all the time at the grocery store, at school or at any community event. The case of SandyNet is quite inspiring especially considering the city of Sandy has a population of under 10,000!\n",
      "Instead of giving dividends to stockholders, SandyNet focuses on keeping prices low for residents. This quote from Joe Knapp really stood out:\n",
      "“We’re able to operate very lean because my service footprint is Sandy and my staff all live and work in Sandy, so we’re able to operate in a different manner than a lot of those companies (AT&T, Verizon, Comcast etc) are”\n",

      "3. Beyond a certain size, any effort loses the “local” touch, but what is that size?\n",
      "3. “If you build it, they will come” is a fallacy, spelling out impact and describing applications is essential\n",
      "Building open access infrastructure is just one part of the equation, spelling out precisely what infrastructure can do increases stakeholder alignment. Not every application can be envisioned from the get go but allocating time to imagine applications and quantify benefits increase likelihood of success. Katie Espeseth, VP of New Products at Electric Power Board (EPB) presented Chattanooga’s story.\n",
      "She emphasized the need to spell out applications and collaborate with partners to put infrastructure to use. What I loved about Katie’s talk was her focus on impact. She set the stage by sharing a quote from Walter Cronkite (American journalist) who called Chattanooga the “dirtiest city in America”. Through photographs she showed how Chattanooga has left behind its dirty city legacy and has now become “Gig city” (i.e. city offering gigabit speed internet access).\n",
      "My favorite example from Katie’s talk was about how high schools students in Chattanooga are able to experience biology and STEM like never before because their fiber network allows for high resolution imagery to get transmitted at very low latency levels. This video shows how students in Chattanooga are learning from a professor based in California while getting to operate a powerful microscope using a mouse thanks in part to a fiber network.\n",

      "4. What is the impact of large scale fiber deployments on utility infrastructure?\n",
      "4. Fiber is (most likely) future proof but conduit has often made all the difference\n",
      "My favorite slide from the conference was presented by Joanne Hovis, CEO of CTC Technologies which showed capabilities of different communication technologies and thanks to an awesome search engine like Google I’ve been able to locate that slide without bothering Joanne!\n",
      "I am personally on the fiber side of the story as well, my current view says that deploying fiber on electric utility infrastructure is our best bet to make Internet for all financially feasible.\n",
      "Fiber’s virtually unlimited capacity is driven by its physics which I don’t understand all that well. However, just noticing the data throughput capability of optical modules over time shows an exponential curve. Considering data consumption grows exponentially as well, fiber as a transport medium seems to be an obvious choice.  What is the difference between fiber and conduit?\n",

      "That said, the most important and relevant comment I took away was from Nathan Rosenberg from the Broadband Group. Nathan said that fiber is “probably” future proof but that presence of conduit is often what has made the difference in feasible projects and unfeasible projects. I loved this quote from him\n",
      "There is such a thing as bad broadband project!\n",

      "5. Customer service is a critical success factor, but a monopoly owning the customer relationship is not the “only” option\n",
      "Everyone present agreed that customer service is critical, however, not all local broadband initiatives are consumer facing ie last mile served by the municipality or cooperative. Some have chosen (eg Ammon Idaho) to take a wholesale approach where infrastructure acts as an enabler. In contrast, EPB feels very strongly about owning the customer relationship themselves.\n",
      "I can see that for towns like Sandy, a consumer facing monopoly makes sense. But for bigger towns it’s possible that complacency sets in eventually and perhaps a wholesale approach would work better.\n",
      "Ammon’s model is described as Open Access Virtual Infrastructure (OAVI) which makes the actual infrastructure available to the end user through the use of virtualization, rather than the infrastructure’s services.  What is the difference between a monopoly and a virtual infrastructure?\n",
      "2. Why do some towns feel the need to have a monopoly on the customer relationship?\n",
      "3. What is the Open Access Virtual Infrastructure (OAVI)?\n",
      "OAVI enhances consumer choice by separating the underlying physical infrastructure from the network services. Each end user is empowered by being presented with his own infrastructure. As a result, every user has the ability to receive and/or deliver services across the infrastructure by utilizing a self provisioned network or by joining a network provided by any other user by joint agreement. Here is how the financial model works:\n",
      "Within the municipal framework, utility infrastructure build costs are paid by the property owners desiring the utility service. This could be done via a standard municipal bond process which requires the support of the property owners who will receive the utility service.\n",
      "The utility infrastructure maintenance and operational costs are paid by the property owners with access to the utility via a monthly utility service fee. It is important to note, that under the OAVI model, the utility service is virtualized infrastructure.\n",
      "Services such as the Internet are delivered across the OAVI with an agreement between the provider and the end user. In this instance the end user is the service provider’s customer. When the end user desires a service other than his or her own, the OAVI model puts the end user in the middle of the network service provider and the infrastructure owner, thereby improving consumer choice and control.\n",
      "Watching the video below on Ammon’s model is well worth your time, it explains Ammon’s model and applications as well.  What is the financial model for OAVI?\n",
      "2. How are the costs for utility infrastructure paid?\n",

      "In my life so far I have started multiple efforts, given up on too many and completed very few. I have often thought about what is it that makes me “show up” each day for the fulfilment of certain objectives but not others? Why do some objectives matter more than others? What is the best way to figure out what matters to me and why? I’ve written quite a bit about ideas of “Chul” and the benefits of understanding the reception conviction of your colleagues.\n",
      "In 2014 for the first time I sat down to write what mattered to me and why? I found that introspection was very challenging, eventually after much struggle I concluded back then that “aligning incentives of driven and capable people with positive character traits (specifically the traits include: zest, grit, curiosity, optimism, self control, gratitude and social intelligence) matters to me because I want to live an incredible life but I don’t want my work to become a source of stress for my family, my colleagues, my customers or my partners.”\n",
      "Living an incredible life meant dedicating all my energies to solving a really big problem that I care about and creating an a**-hole proof environment in the process.\n",
      "2015 turned out to be an incredible year of self discovery. I came across the work of Ken Robinson who describes ways through which anyone can “find their element”. For Ken, our element is where talent meets passion. But is passion static? are talents static? I don’t think so. If talent and passion keeps evolving then so does our element. Considering our element keeps evolving, the same must be true for other human beings who collaborate with us to help achieve certain objectives.\n",
      "For me, the answer of what mattered to me and why evolved as well. What I wrote in 2014 is still true, but it still is a means to an end. I have spent the past 2.5 years continuing to write down iterations of the same question and as of today I think levelling the playing field for all consciousness matters to me, but specifically what that’s now boiled down to is the following:\n",
      "I want to dedicate my time and energy to join efforts through which I can significantly accelerate the following outcomes: a) make internet access free, b) make electricity access abundant / free and c) make financial capital abundant.\n",
      "I believe the above 3 outcomes will happen irrespective of my efforts, I simply want to join conversations where the above 3 goals are a core focus. My hypothesis is that I will find beautiful minds across the globe if I join such conversations. After all, we are the “average of 5 people we spend most of our time with” and so the likelihood of me pushing up my average by talking to people who intend solving audacious goals is quite high\n",
      "My journey has taught me that passions are not static. They evolve and that’s a problem to some extent for leaders and founders in particular because passions only get tested when the going gets tough. Often what separates success stories from failures is grit and persistence.\n",
      "I believe that as entrepreneurs when we declare a commitment to a vision, we are making a statement about our passions and our convictions. It is the quality of our introspection that ensures authenticity of our stated purpose, and in my view determines the likelihood of our success.\n",
      "As such, I turned to technology and research to improve the quality of my introspection  What makes someone \"show up\" each day for the fulfilment of certain objectives but not others?\n",

      "What gets measured gets done, what gets rewarded gets done repeatedly\n",
      "When I genuinely started introspecting, I found the process of introspection to be quite flawed and prevailing academic literature seemed to suggest the same. So about 2 years I decided to measure my daily activity by installing a highly invasive application on my computer and smartphone, called Desktime\n",
      "Measuring exactly how I was spending my time in 2014 helped me get a better sense of the delta between my actions and stated beliefs. So in 2015, I started pushing for change and initiated a process through which I could extract myself from my commitments in order to focus on what was really important. I found that measurement solidified my conviction and helped me follow through on actions which some of my friends thought were a bit “outrageous”. They felt this simply because I had a rather “stable / well paying job”.\n",
      "As preparation for this talk, I decided to do a literature review and found an excellent paper that was published on HBR which captures my thought process in a much better way.  What gets measured gets done - what does this mean for the individual?\n",

      "“The first step in managing your commitments is to take a quick inventory of what matters to you. (For a helpful work sheet, see the exhibit “Taking Stock.”) You probably have at least a vague sense of what you value most, but it’s important to clarify those themes from time to time. This exercise lets you check whether you are putting your money (and your time and energy) where your mouth is. A systematic inventory of where your money, time, and energy are going often reveals surprising gaps.”\n",
      "In addition to Desktime, I think your credit card statement or a tool like Expenify can help fill the money column most accurately. Energy is subjective, but a good rule of thumb: energy is maximum 90 minutes after waking up and then declines through out the day. So give more weightage to activities done 90 minutes after waking up. Clearly answering e mails shouldn’t be the first order of business!\n",
      "Some gems from this paper:\n",
      "“Our most binding commitments are frequently the result of day-to-day decisions too small to attract our attention.”\n",
      "“The ruts that lock people into active inertia are the very commitments that led to their past successes but that have now hardened: Strategic frames become blinders, selected processes lapse into routines, relationships turn into shackles, resources become millstones, and once vibrant values ossify into dogmas.”\n",
      "“Some of us experience “commitment creep.” We often commit ourselves without really thinking about what we are taking on. It is very easy to say yes to new commitments without reflecting on the long-term costs of honoring the implied promises or the potential conflicts that may develop with existing commitments.”\n",
      "Importance of crises:\n",
      "Crises force people to figure out what really matters.\n",
      "Crises force people to make choices.\n",
      "Crises can nullify outdated commitments.\n",
      "Crises prompt people to clear their diaries.\n",
      "Crises help to break the cycle of success.\n",
      "“The Clutter Trap.\n",
      "We fall into this trap when we are not systematically undoing old commitments as we take on new ones. As a result, so many promises — new and old — call out for our time and other resources that we may meet none of them or simply fall back on what we were doing before. Many of us have experienced this in our professional lives when we attend management meetings that add new items to our to-do list without removing existing ones. Taken as a whole, the agenda that emerges can be impossible. “\n",

      "Consider taking the Learned Optimism test\n",
      "Hacking flow states, through the Flow Genome Project\n",
      "The general view being that being in a state of flow allows for much better quality introspection. Mindfulness exercises through apps like Calm and Headpsace are highly recommended.  What are some of the commitments you have made recently?\n",

      "Lessons Learned [20 mins]\n",
      "To get a better sense of why introspection is often flawed, becoming more aware about how our mind is wired and how our brain makes decisions, it’s critical to understand the unconscious, something Leonard Mlodinow explains very well in this talk\n",
      "Talk starts with an exercise to explain anchoring on the likely cost of a stay in a hotel(here’s a super cognitive bias cheat sheet)\n",
      "Incredible examples are used to show case how the brain confuses itself in terms of identifying actual colour AND the brain’s inability to tell what the actual expression is when the face is upside down\n",
      "Bottomline: the path to identifying what matters to you and why starts with awareness, it helps to understand our brain’s natural limitations and biases, and finally, without being completely honest to oneself, all introspective exercises are futility\n",
      "Perhaps the biggest challenge remains the ability to find alignment between what we actually believe deep deep inside and the statements we make to the external world about our source of motivation\n",
      "We can all figure out what really matters to us, all we really need to get there is a growth mindset, a term and a very powerful idea coined by Carol Dweck.\n",
      "Vulnerability is the birthplace of creativity, innovation and change….The effect you have on others is the most valuable currency there is…Be weary of fear disguised as practicality…Choose love, not fear…and don’t be afraid to live an incredible life.\n",
      "A lot of my learning related to my inner world has happened because of my wife, she has pretty much introduced me to most sources mentioned here. My wife’s latest discovery in her pursuit of her own self discovery is Angela Duckworth who has written an amazing book called Grit which pretty much brings together a whole lot of lessons I have sort of observed, but never had the ability to accurately articulate\n",
      "Grit is doing what you love, but not just falling in love — staying in love\n",
      "In Chapter 4 of Angela Duckworth’s book — Grit, she dives into something she calls the Grit Scale, and the big message delivered is that grit does not mean dogged intensity. Grit means finding consistency with investing 10,000 hours of practise while continuing to push towards one common higher order goal or life philosophy.\n",
      "“…[D]ogged perseverance toward a top-level goal requires, paradoxically perhaps, some flexibility at lower levels in the goal hierarchy. It’s as if the highest-level goal gets written in ink, once you’ve done enough living and reflecting to know what that goal is, and the lower-level goals get written in pencil, so you can revise them and sometimes erase them altogether, and then figure out new ones to take their place.”  What is the unconscious?\n",
      "2. What is the path to identifying what matters to you and why?\n",
      "3. What is the biggest challenge in self-discovery?\n",
      "4. What does Angela Duckworth's book, Grit, teach about self-discovery?\n",
      "1. What is a fiduciary duty?\n",
      "2. What did the author do when he first became a director?\n",
      "3. What did the author learn from reading two books?\n",
